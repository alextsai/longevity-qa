DJ’s life is one marked by extraordinary strivings, wins, setbacks and comebacks that together have shaped his approach to overcoming challenges of all kinds and to daily life. DJ explains a regimen of clear, practical steps and a mental stance that can allow anyone—male, female, young or old—to build extreme resilience of mind and body and to be successful in family and work. We also discuss his experience with new, emerging treatments for addiction, PTSD and depression that many people, not just veterans, are benefiting from. The tools DJ describes to “stack small wins” and to be ultra-intentional about your mindset will be of immense benefit to anyone wishing to achieve the best version of themselves.

We explore the science behind human mate selection in both short- and long-term relationships. We discuss universal traits valued in long-term partners along with key differences between women and men in what they prioritize when selecting a mate. We also discuss the darker aspects of mating behavior, such as deception, the evolutionary function of jealousy and the motivations behind stalking.

0UyOAtjKXpM,You Can Learn New Habits Very Fast: Brain Circuits Rewire Faster With Urgency,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UyOAtjKXpM,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2025-09-29T18:34:56Z,112167,3022,"We’ve all heard “it takes 21 days to form a new habit,” and other times we hear it’s 30 days or 60 days.

The truth is this: neural circuits will rewire at a rate that is proportional to how urgent the new behavior is.

Now, of course, there are skills (physical, language, music, etc.) that need time in order to form. That’s a different form of neuroplasticity. But it’s also one that can be accelerated. It involves focus, errors (which are the signal for neural circuits to change), reflection on those errors later and quality sleep, especially in the two nights that follow the attempt to learn a new skill.

On the episode of the Huberman Lab podcast out now, my guest is Dr. Poppy Crum (yes, that’s her actual given name!). She’s a neuroscientist, professor at Stanford and former Chief of Research at Dolby Labs.

We discussed rewiring your brain circuits by using different tools, and we discussed that in the context of habit formation and new skill development. Excitingly, Poppy shares how you can use simple video of a skill you’re trying to learn and zero-cost AI to get critical, elite-level feedback and thereby learn that skill faster.

She generously provided instructions for how to use AI for different health and learning purposes. They’re in the caption of the episode and they are easy to use and free.

And we discussed how to use zero-cost technologies to control your home environment for healthier and better living."

I discuss the immune system's three primary layers of defense, emphasizing how each contributes to protection from infection. I share practical tools to enhance immune function and accelerate recovery from sickness, including specific breathing patterns, sleep positioning and targeted supplementation. I also explore the powerful mind-body connection, showing how mindset and nervous system activation can directly influence the body's ability to heal.

JgOx50_ogJw,Why Lifting Tempo Doesn’t Impact Muscle Growth as Much as You Think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgOx50_ogJw,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2025-09-23T19:50:49Z,65980,1028,"Ok, this one surprised me. I was always taught that to get maximum hypertrophy and strength increases, I should lower the weight at least twice as slowly as I lift it on each repetition and really resist the lowering (eccentric) portion in the final repetitions.

Turns out, according to @bretcontreras1, this week’s guest on Huberman Lab, the tempo of lifting and lowering a weight does not impact hypertrophy very much, but he points out that you do need to control the concentric (lifting) and eccentric (lowering) phases of each rep and not use momentum to avoid injury.

I have a feeling this one might spark some controversy, so tell us what your experience is in the comments.

On the episode, we discuss how to get selective muscle growth. For instance, a lot of people want to increase the strength and size of their glutes (Bret is the expert on this; see his clients...), but not their legs, or perhaps increase their arms or their calves, etc. Or maybe you want even growth across all muscles.

Bret explains how to organize your training schedule and the specific workouts to do in order to accomplish your unique goals with resistance training.

He has decades of experience, and his clients show remarkable “before and after” progress. He also has a PhD in the topic, and he walks the walk (unlike a lot of exercise scientists, he has built a lot of muscle).

And if you’re wondering if his advice pertains to women and men, keep in mind that most of his clients are women, but he trains men as well. His programs/techniques work."

Bret is known as “the glute guy” for his expertise in helping people build their ideal physique, including how to grow and/or strengthen their gluteus muscles. He explains how to resistance train to improve strength, hypertrophy and aesthetics, and to overcome genetically or injury-induced weaker body parts. We cover ideal training frequency, exercise selection, sets and repetitions and periodization. Our discussion is for women and men of any age and experience level seeking to maximize their aesthetics, performance and longevity.

2t4vswC-3mY,How to Expand Your Consciousness | Dr. Christof Koch,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t4vswC-3mY,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2025-09-15T12:00:06Z,136195,4058,"My guest is Dr. Christof Koch, PhD, a pioneering researcher on the topic of consciousness, an investigator at the Allen Institute for Brain Science and the chief scientist at the Tiny Blue Dot Foundation. We discuss the neuroscience of consciousness—how it arises in our brain, how it shapes our identity and how we can modify and expand it. Dr. Koch explains how we all experience life through a unique “perception box,” which holds our beliefs, our memories and thus our biases about reality. We discuss how human consciousness is changed by meditation, non-sleep deep rest, psychedelics, dreams and virtual reality. We also discuss neuroplasticity (rewiring the brain), flow states and the ever-changing but also persistent aspect of the “collective consciousness” of humanity.

I highlight specific nutrients, including omega-3 fatty acids, creatine, phosphatidylserine, anthocyanins, choline and glutamine, and discuss their recommended doses and dietary sources. I also describe how taste perception, gut-brain signaling and learned associations shape what foods we prefer and crave. Finally, I share practical behavioral tools to help rewire your food preferences toward healthier choices.

Dr. Crum explains that our mindsets—for example, what we believe about stress, exercise and the food we eat—shape how we feel, behave and even how our bodies respond. We discuss studies showing simply believing a food is indulgent can shift satiety hormones and that viewing your daily activity as real exercise can improve weight loss and health markers. We also discuss how to reframe stress so it becomes a tool for growth and improved performance.

We discuss how to envision massive goals in any part of life and the process of breaking down those goals into actionable daily steps. Alex shares how embracing your uniqueness and mortality is the most powerful way to envision and live a fuller, more intentional life. We also discuss strength and endurance training, assessing risk and how Alex prepares mentally and physically for extreme challenges. We also discuss how to balance goal-seeking with family and work. Regardless of your goals, profession or age, this conversation will very likely reshape how you think about and approach your life, goals and potential.

Whe2Jh9q6jI,Science & Health Benefits of Belief in God & Religion | Dr. David DeSteno,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe2Jh9q6jI,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2025-08-25T12:00:56Z,173833,5750,"My guest is ⁠Dr. David DeSteno, PhD⁠, a professor of psychology at Northeastern University. We discuss science, God and religion, including what science can and can’t reveal about the existence of God and where religious faith and science do and do not align. We also discuss why questions about life’s origins, miracles and the afterlife have persisted across time. Dr. DeSteno explains how religious rituals cause meaningful improvements in mental and physical health and how prayer and gratitude can markedly reduce stress, increase honesty and compassion and buffer against loneliness and despair. Finally, we explore what distinguishes religions and mission-based communities from cults, and we discuss the role that communities such as 12-step and Burning Man play in modern life.

We discuss how light powerfully shapes mood, sleep, appetite, learning and overall mental health by aligning—or misaligning—our internal circadian clock. We explain practical protocols to support your circadian rhythm, including morning sunlight exposure, dim evening lighting and regular mealtimes. We also discuss strategies to manage jet lag, limit evening screen use, ease seasonal depression and improve focus by syncing light, sleep and food with natural biological rhythms.

We discuss how the body and brain regulate temperature in different conditions and why conventional cooling methods, such as placing ice packs on the neck, do not effectively reduce core body temperature. Dr. Heller explains why cooling glabrous skin areas—the palms, soles and upper face—efficiently releases body heat and can significantly enhance physical performance and endurance. We discuss how targeted palmar cooling improves both short-term performance and long-term training adaptation in aerobic and anaerobic exercise.

oeVfCqlHn_I,Tools to Set Your Cortisol Rhythm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeVfCqlHn_I,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2025-08-06T18:38:06Z,342987,23219,"Getting your cortisol rhythm correct is essential to energy and sleep and much more.  
 
The new Huberman Lab episode covers everything you need to know about how to get your cortisol rhythm correct.  

You want high levels of cortisol in the morning and late morning and low levels at night. I teach you how to do that and the biology underlying the protocols.  
  
Caffeine surprisingly does not increase cortisol very much if you drink it regularly. If you don’t drink it regularly it will increase cortisol.  

Deliberate cold exposure does not increase cortisol very much; in fact, it can decrease your cortisol levels if you do it regularly. Yep, you read right. Two times per week or more is regularly.  

Exercise is best done in the early part of the day to match your circadian cortisol rhythm, but if you can’t do it early in the day (and many of us can’t) exercise in the afternoon or evening should be followed by a few simple things to lower your cortisol. I discussed those in the episode. Otherwise, your next-morning cortisol is reduced and, over time, this can lead to type 2 burnout (explained on the episode and how to overcome it).  

Licorice root is a potent elevator of cortisol. This can be used early in the day but approach with caution. It can interact with medications. I’ve been using it in the morning and it’s great.  

Same goes for grapefruit, although grapefruit works through a different mechanism. It increases the duration over which cortisol is active and is less potent than licorice for cortisol.  

The episode also explains how nutrition impacts cortisol, low-carb diets, and more. Lots in there and it’s all time-stamped so you can navigate quickly to the topic most of interest to you."
Ibj1k3IZTNU,How to Control Your Cortisol & Overcome Burnout,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibj1k3IZTNU,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2025-08-04T12:00:37Z,321131,9935,"In this episode, I explain cortisol and science-based protocols for properly setting your cortisol rhythm, which can significantly increase your daytime energy, focus, mood, and stress resilience, while also improving your sleep quality.

Most people mistakenly think cortisol is bad, and many assume their levels are too high, when in fact many health and performance challenges simply stem from a disrupted cortisol rhythm. Getting your cortisol rhythm right can be transformative for your health and performance.

I outline behavioral, nutritional, and supplement-based strategies to raise or lower your cortisol levels at the appropriate times of day and night. I also provide specific protocols for overcoming burnout.

If you’re dealing with stress, low energy, hormone or sleep challenges—or simply want to optimize these for the sake of your physical and mental health and performance—this episode offers science-backed protocols to help.

LAwBdRR4wQk,ADHD & How Anyone Can Improve Their Focus | Huberman Lab Essentials,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAwBdRR4wQk,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2025-07-31T12:00:38Z,265889,9727,"In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explore the biology and psychology of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and discuss both prescription and non-prescription treatment options.   

I discuss the neural circuits involved in attention and concentration, emphasizing dopamine's role in regulating and coordinating focus. I explain how common prescription stimulants like Ritalin, Adderall, and Modafinil act on the brain to treat ADHD, and discuss non-drug approaches, including supplements and behavioral training to support focus. The episode offers tools and insights beneficial not only for those with ADHD but for anyone seeking to improve attention and focus.

k8SBJzsIWAo,Male vs. Female Brain Differences & How They Arise From Genes & Hormones | Dr. Nirao Shah,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8SBJzsIWAo,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2025-07-28T12:01:28Z,173917,4330,"My guest is Dr. Nirao Shah, MD, PhD, a professor of psychiatry, behavioral sciences and neurobiology at Stanford University School of Medicine. We discuss how the brains of males and females differ and how those differences arise from different genes and hormones during fetal development, in childhood and adulthood. We discuss what drives male- versus female-specific behaviors and how hormonal fluctuations across the lifespan, including puberty, the menstrual cycle, menopause and aging – affect behavior, cognition and health. Additionally, we discuss how biology relates to gender identity and the impact of hormone therapies on brain circuits that regulate mating, parenting and social bonding.

HWcphoKlbxY,Understanding & Conquering Depression | Huberman Lab Essentials,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWcphoKlbxY,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2025-07-03T12:00:30Z,165780,5224,"In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explore major depression, including its underlying biology and discuss science-based approaches to alleviate symptoms and improve mood.

I describe the wide-ranging symptoms of depression and explain how key neurotransmitters, hormones, stress, genetics and inflammation contribute to its development and persistence. I also cover treatment options, from traditional classes of antidepressant medications to emerging therapies such as ketamine and psilocybin. Finally, I highlight lifestyle-based tools, including exercise, supplementation and dietary strategies that can help manage depressive symptoms and promote mental well-being.

We discuss how dopamine drives reward, motivation and addictive behaviors. Dr. Lembke explains the concept of the pleasure-pain balance of dopamine and how this cycle plays a key role in the development and persistence of addiction. We also discuss some of the challenges of addiction recovery, including withdrawal, relapses and the potential benefits of psychedelic-assisted therapy.

I also explain how to control vagal pathways to enhance your focus and alertness to improve learning and neuroplasticity. And I explain how your vagus nerve controls levels of serotonin in both your gut and brain, impacting your mood and emotional resilience and how to keep that pathway robust.

I discuss both the hardwired mechanisms and subjective factors that shape an individual’s perception of pain and pleasure. I also explain why pain thresholds vary from person to person and discuss various treatments for pain management such as acupuncture and supplements. Finally, I explain the role of key neurochemicals like dopamine and serotonin in mediating our experience of pain and pleasure.

We discuss how particular daily life choices undermine our level of joy, our sense of purpose, our physical and our mental health and the daily, weekly, monthly and yearly steps we can all take to vastly increase our level of motivation, gratitude and overall life satisfaction. We discuss how effortful foraging for information, undistracted reflection and physical exercise are ways to ‘invest’ and therefore grow our levels of dopamine, energy and motivation, whereas low-friction activities are specifically designed to hijack or diminish them. We also discuss dopamine reward circuitry in the context of how to build and reset one’s energy levels and create a deeper sense of purpose in work, creative pursuits and relationships.

We discuss which scientific questions ought to be the priority for NIH, how to incentivize bold, innovative science especially from younger labs, how to solve the replication crisis and restore trust and transparency in science and public health, including acknowledging prior failures by the NIH. We discuss the COVID-19 pandemic and the data and sociological factors that motivated lockdowns, masking and vaccine mandates. Dr. Bhattacharya shares his views on how to resolve the vaccine–autism debate and how best to find the causes and cures for autism and chronic diseases. The topics we cover impact everyone: male, female, young and old and, given that NIH is the premier research and public health organization in the world, extend to Americans and non-Americans alike.

2ZkJtIouKzE,Improving Health With Stronger Brain-Body Connection | Huberman Lab Essentials,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZkJtIouKzE,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2025-06-05T12:00:07Z,150616,4944,"In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I discuss interoception, the brain’s ability to sense and interpret signals from the body, which shapes our sense of self and underlies vital functions like focus, sleep, healing and emotions.

I explain how the body communicates different types of information to the brain, influencing processes like digestion, heart rate and immune function.

I also describe practical tools such as breathwork to regulate alertness, strategies to support gut health and reduce sugar cravings, and awareness practices to enhance interoception. By understanding and applying these tools, you can strengthen the brain-body connection to improve mood, overall health and performance.

We discuss what happens in the brain and body when we grieve, the role of dopamine and yearning in the grieving process, the health risks of getting stuck at particular stages of grief and how to move through loss while also deeply honoring the person, animal or thing that is no longer with us. Dr. O’Connor explains that grief involves cycling back and forth between protest and despair (often guilt and anger too) and explains science-supported ways to move through that process in the healthiest possible way. Everyone experiences grief and loss at some point. Dr. O’Connor provides valuable knowledge and tools to help you navigate grief under any circumstance.

We discuss the interplay between genes and behaviors, including how certain behaviors can improve resilience by changing gene and organ function, as well as natural selection events happening in humans today.

We also discuss the immune system–related reasons people find the smells of potential mates attractive—or not.

We explore how physical and psychological traits are passed from one generation to the next, and the specific behaviors that can influence gene expression to improve health and performance.

Melissa explains her lab’s pioneering research on breath-hold training and how activation of the dive reflex through breath holding can significantly improve oxygen availability by changing spleen size and function.

We also delve into the medical uses and ethics of gene editing to cure disease in both babies and adults.

For those interested in genes and inheritance, human performance, immune system function, and natural selection, this episode illustrates the remarkable interplay between human nature and nurture.

We discuss the “how-to” of comedy writing and storytelling, and what the science of humor and the creative process reveal about human emotion and memory. We explore why surprise and the act of “saying the unspoken truth” activate the brain’s reward circuits, as well as the subconscious mechanisms that shape our sense of what is funny. The episode also examines the bi-directional influence between comedy and cultural standards. It will interest anyone curious about the science of humor, the art of performance and emotional contagion.

He is known for his pioneering research on the impact of dietary interventions on weight loss and health.

We compare ketogenic, vegetarian, vegan and omnivorous diets—and why there is no one-size-fits-all approach. All agree, however, that eliminating or dramatically reducing processed foods is best for health.

We discuss the protein needs controversy; plant vs. animal proteins; the importance of fiber and low-sugar fermented foods for gut health and inflammation; and how diet affects gene expression. We also review food allergies—including gluten, wheat, dairy and soy—as well as raw dairy.

The episode offers data-supported advice for healthier eating.

I explain how the auditory system captures sound waves and how the brain interprets these signals to make sense of the environment. I also discuss the use of white noise and binaural beats to support brain states conducive to learning, focus and relaxation. Additionally, I explain how the vestibular system helps maintain balance and examine practical tools to enhance auditory learning, cognitive performance and mood.

1e4QdH-LeKc,People Who Do Prenuptial Contracts Stay Together Longer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e4QdH-LeKc,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2025-05-08T04:32:39Z,1361115,32445,"The Huberman Lab episode out this week is about contracts for love and money—which might sound like a downer, but as attorney James Sexton explains, these contracts are more about defining the specific things people need in order to feel respected and safe, as opposed to protecting “the ending.” In fact, much of what goes into these agreements is about the marriage, not divorce conditions.

Also, somewhat counterintuitively, people who create prenuptial agreements get divorced far less than the average population. The current divorce rate in the United States is 56% (!).

Note: The episode is not really about divorce. It’s about love, and it also addresses the forces outside a relationship that can erode it, as well as the things to pay attention to in order to avoid those increasingly common pitfalls.

Through both his profession and his life, James has adopted a unique and important perspective on all of this. It’s an episode that ought to benefit anyone—married, single, divorced, etc.—because it addresses the emotional and legal contracts around romantic relationships that most everyone encounters at some point.

James is also an amazing storyteller and a genuinely good human being. It was a pleasure to host him."

We explore the counterintuitive fact that people with prenuptial agreements tend to stay married longer and report more satisfying relationships than those who don’t. We discuss how legal contracts can foster deeper understanding by encouraging vulnerability and honest communication about each partner’s values and expectations.

We also examine what defines true, lasting love versus generic romantic ideals—and how social media can distort our understanding of what we truly need. Additionally, we review how cultural traditions, gender dynamics, courtship length, and age at the time of marriage shape marital outcomes.

This episode offers practical tools for anyone—single or partnered—to build more successful and stable relationships through deeply honest dialogue and contracts that reflect genuine values around love and money.

I explain how these senses help us detect chemicals in the environment and respond to a variety of environmental cues. I discuss the connection between the olfactory system and cognitive performance, and I provide practical tools to enhance learning, sensory function, and brain health. Additionally, I examine how chemical signals exchanged between people subtly influence emotions, biology, and social bonds.

We discuss the often overlooked needs of domesticated animals—primarily dogs and cats—and the things we can do to improve their well-being and our relationship with them.

We cover how to interpret animal body language, the unique needs of specific dog breeds, and the needs of cats and birds. We also discuss the pros and cons of spaying and neutering and how weaning age impacts a pet’s attachment style. Whether you’re a pet owner, trainer, or simply an animal lover, this episode teaches you how specific pet behaviors are rooted in their immutable biology—and the simple things you can do to vastly improve your pets’ health and well-being, as well as your relationship with them.

I discuss how endurance—the ability to sustain effort—requires the coordination of physical and mental systems driven by energy availability, brain willpower, and specific training adaptations in the muscles, heart, lungs and neurons. I explain conditioning protocols designed to enhance four types of endurance, from long-duration steady state to muscular endurance and high-intensity intervals, and how each training style triggers unique adaptations in the body and brain, such as improved mitochondrial function and oxygen utilization. Additionally, I highlight the crucial role of hydration and electrolytes, which are essential for neural function and influence the brain’s willpower to sustain effort.

Rk02H9r_E4A,Why “Idiot Compassion” (Aka Yeslighting) Is Not Effective Support,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk02H9r_E4A,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2025-04-11T16:57:48Z,122839,4087,"Lori Gottlieb is a world-renowned expert on relationships: finding them, being in them, moving forward if or after they end, and how to repair them.

Here, she explains a common phenomenon in which people seek support from friends when they encounter challenges in relationships. While she acknowledges the benefits of talking to friends about these matters, she emphasizes that most of the time, the compassion we think is helping people merely provides a Band-Aid in the short term—and leads to more suffering overall and in the long run.

She distinguishes “idiot compassion” from “wise compassion,” which emphasizes our role in the problems we encounter in relationships of all kinds.

During the episode, we discuss a wide range of topics related to finding and being an excellent romantic partner. She offers actionable protocols based on decades of experience helping clients find and build the relationships they want most.

It’s an episode that ought to benefit everyone, including those already in a relationship, as it also focuses on how to be a better partner.

We also discuss the impact of modern technology on relationships."

I explain how the nervous system drives muscle movement, the key differences between training for hypertrophy or strength, and resistance training protocols to build muscle for performance and healthy aging. Additionally, I discuss tools for assessing recovery and the role of key nutrients—such as creatine and electrolytes—in supporting muscle development and performance. This episode provides actionable, science-backed strategies to enhance movement, preserve strength with age, and boost energy levels.

We discuss the critical importance of oral care and the oral microbiome for brain and bodily health. We examine the negative effects of common oral care product ingredients such as alcohol, astringents, and bleaches. We also explore the history and real impact of fluoridated drinking water on oral, bone, and systemic health.

Then we discuss healthy, lesser-known solutions for bad breath, canker sores, cavities, and teeth whitening. We cover how teeth can be made to repair their own cavities and the connection between oral health and cardiovascular health, male and female fertility, dementia, and cancer.

This episode goes far beyond the best approaches to brushing and flossing and will be a valuable resource for anyone seeking to improve their oral health and appearance at any age.

I explain why overheating can hinder performance and endurance and how techniques like palmar cooling can help extend physical effort by aiding temperature regulation. I also highlight how specific body areas, such as the palms and face, are key targets for regulating temperature, allowing heat to dissipate efficiently. Lastly, I discuss how temperature can support training recovery while cautioning that extreme cold, such as ice baths immediately after training, can block adaptations.

We discuss how to use plyometric work to improve mobility, strength, posture, and overall health.

We emphasize the enormous benefits of skipping—a form of plyometrics—for joint health, aerobic conditioning, and coordination, as well as its advantages for people of all ages and fitness levels. We also explore the expressive nature of human movement, highlighting how certain movements reveal and can evolve one’s unique personality and abilities.

Stu explains how resistance training, skipping, and striding can improve movement efficiency in all aspects of life. Anyone who exercises, as well as serious athletes, will benefit immensely from Stu McMillan’s knowledge of human mechanics and the practical tools he generously shares in this discussion.

I discuss the mechanism through which cortisol and epinephrine (adrenaline) impact the brain and body and why it’s important to regulate their levels, considering factors like time of day or stress levels. I also cover the positive benefits of short-term stress and behavioral protocols to increase energy and enhance stress resilience. Additionally, I explain how to optimize hormone levels through tools like sunlight exposure, meal timing, and supplements such as ashwagandha.

I discuss the pathways through which the brain and body interact to produce thyroid hormone and growth hormone, and how these hormones influence essential processes like tissue growth and repair, body composition, and energy production. I explain how thyroid hormone levels are influenced by key nutrients, such as iodine, selenium, and L-tyrosine. I also explain how practices such as exercise, sleep, meditation and sauna can offset age-related declines in growth hormone, to optimize overall hormone health and metabolism.

That’s also true, but it has the greatest power to positively impact your mitochondria. There’s also evidence that it can improve testosterone and estrogen levels in both men and women.

Every time I talk about this, people say, “There’s no sun here.” Unless you live in a cave, there’s sun. But it is true that on overcast days, long-wavelength light is filtered out.

It’s still important to get sunlight in your eyes on those days for circadian rhythm regulation. On overcast days, as well as when you need more mitochondrial stimulation, red light devices can be useful. Most of them emit both red light and infrared or near-infrared light.

Full disclosure: Joovv is a sponsor of tge Huberman Lab podcast because, to my knowledge, those are the only medical-grade red and infrared light devices that are commercially available.

One of the really cool things about long-wavelength light, regardless of the source, is that it can penetrate deep into the skin and scatter as much as 8 cm.

In this post, I talk about how to avoid excess UV exposure while still getting plenty of long-wavelength light from the sun.

I did an entire episode about light—Episode 4 of the Huberman Lab podcast. The episode out now with Roger Seheult, M.D., also covers this in detail, including how red light can improve blood glucose regulation.

The last point is that photobiomodulation is now considered a core component of dermatology and other fields of medicine."

I describe how the body senses nutrient levels and how the brain processes these signals to stimulate hunger or suppress appetite. I also discuss how certain foods can help curb hunger, while processed foods and emulsifiers can interfere with satiety signals, leading to overeating. Additionally, I cover how lifestyle factors such as exercise and meal timing regulate blood glucose levels, which in turn impact hunger and appetite.

rkFHdXo1O0w,How to Build Strength & Endurance,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkFHdXo1O0w,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2025-02-21T15:38:05Z,314909,9912,"Pavel Tsatsouline is one of the world’s top authorities on building strength, endurance, and flexibility.

We discussed a topic that I believe isn’t covered enough: how to get strong without necessarily adding muscle size. Many people don’t want to be much bigger, but most everybody wants endurance. It’s possible to train for both simultaneously. It also turns out that training for strength with low repetitions (two to five reps) is safer than training with high repetitions—if done correctly. That’s because higher repetitions fatigue the stabilizing muscles. Still, there’s a proper way to train heavy, and Pavel explains it.

Hypertrophy training, or training for muscle size, is far more draining to the systemic nervous system than most people realize. So if you struggle with post-workout fatigue or experience brain fog later in the day, you might try training with heavier weights and lower repetitions for a while, focusing on strength instead.

We also discussed the longevity benefits of training for strength and endurance. And for those who want to add muscle size, Pavel explains shorter workouts that can be used to augment a strength program while minimizing inroads to recovery.

Additionally, we covered how to build flexibility, all with minimal time investment. Pavel is a true expert and a no-frills instructor. There’s something for everyone in this episode—it definitely applies to both women and men."

I discuss how biological masculinization and feminization depend on factors such as genetics, hormone ratios, and receptor availability. I also explore how hormones like testosterone, estrogen, and other steroid hormones influence sexual characteristics and brain development. Additionally, I examine the impact of environmental factors—such as herbicides like atrazine, cannabis, alcohol, and even cell phones—on hormone function and reproductive health.

We discuss the most effective and efficient ways to build strength, endurance, and flexibility. We cover bodyweight-only, free-weight, and machine-based protocols and describe training splits and lesser-known but highly effective ways to train, especially for people with limited time.

We also discuss local versus systemic nervous system and muscle recovery, how to complete training sessions with increased energy, why training to “failure” is not advised, optimal rest-between-sets protocols to improve performance, and how to vary effort levels across each week and month to ensure regular progress. This episode brings you highly practical, science-supported, and real-world-tested training methods to build strength, endurance, and flexibility from one of the world’s top experts.

I describe how early infant bonds and puberty shape adult patterns of emotional connection. I explain that understanding emotions requires recognizing both internal states and external cues, along with strategies to enhance your emotional awareness. Additionally, I discuss the key elements of healthy emotional bonds and provide practical tools to deepen one’s understanding of emotions, leading to a richer emotional life.

She explains how specific ways of framing and asking questions about the world shape our physical health and rate of aging. Dr. Langer also explains how our perception of time and control significantly impact our rate of physical healing, hormones, immune system, and longevity. She describes mindfulness as a way of framing life, not simply a meditation or other practice, and discusses data showing how to use one’s mind to overcome health challenges and achieve remarkable outcomes. Dr. Langer is a luminary and pioneer in researching the relationship between the mind and body with scientific rigor. Her work and our discussion are applicable to women and men of all ages and walks of life.

_2u_FiHTuvQ,Use the “MIQ Process” to Excel in Any Endeavor,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2u_FiHTuvQ,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2025-02-02T23:29:26Z,51980,2516,"Chess prodigy Josh Waitzkin developed a process to achieve peak performance in any craft or career. He has applied it to investing, professional sports, science, and more. The MIQ Process, or Most Important Question process, is not a quick fix but rather a rewiring of your default settings.

A key aspect of this process is creating space in the stimulus-response dimensions of life—not filling every moment with input. Instead, you seed your mind with critical questions and allow space to capture the answers. This applies to career, relationships, or any other important aspect of life.

We cannot deny the power of the unconscious mind to solve the problems we consciously feed it. Solid science supports this. Josh has achieved immense success in chess, martial arts, and business. His work coaching individuals across disparate careers further underscores the value of this approach."

I discuss the key role dopamine plays in driving cravings and motivating action. I explain how dopamine regulates the balance between pleasure and pain, and what happens when this system becomes dysregulated, leading to addiction. I discuss the role of molecules like serotonin, which help enhance the enjoyment of the present, and explain how to balance the drive for more while staying focused in the present. I also discuss the causes of procrastination and describe strategies to boost dopamine levels through behavioral approaches or supplements.

Q4qWzbP0q7I,How Foods & Nutrients Control Our Moods | Huberman Lab Essentials,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4qWzbP0q7I,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2025-01-23T13:00:28Z,490159,13493,"In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explain how the different nutrients and foods we eat impact our emotions and overall mood.

I discuss how the mind-body connection shapes our food choices and cravings, highlighting the roles of key neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin in driving eating behaviors. I explain the biological mechanisms behind cravings for specific foods, such as sugar, and how psychological factors like belief effects can influence our perception of hunger. I also describe how certain nutrients, like omega-3 fatty acids, and a healthy gut microbiome are crucial in mood regulation and immune function.

We discuss the origins of the universe and how humans have used light and optics to understand where and how life on Earth emerged.

We explore how early humans charted the stars, sun, moon, and other celestial events to measure time and track seasons, as well as how stargazing continues to connect us to a shared ancient experience. Additionally, we examine the scientific process, the practical and ethical challenges of pursuing groundbreaking discoveries, and the emotional toll of striving for recognition in one’s profession.

Finally, we discuss whether astrology has any scientific validity and consider the possibility of life beyond Earth.

I explain how many of the positive effects of exercise on brain function occur through the action of specific neurochemicals that increase alertness.

I also cover how to best time exercise and which specific types of exercise to include in your weekly routine to maximize benefits for your brain. Additionally, I explain how certain types of exercise trigger the release of a hormone from your bones called osteocalcin, as well as brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Together, these substances increase neuroplasticity and enhance learning.

The positive effects of exercise on brain oxygenation, blood supply, and fuel utilization are also discussed. Listeners will learn how to design a weekly exercise program that optimizes physical fitness, brain health, longevity, and performance, along with the mechanistic logic behind those recommendations.

We discuss the psychology and neuroscience of human drives, sustaining motivation, choosing a direction and vision for one’s life, and the guideposts within philosophy, culture, and religion that can help us select and navigate the best possible path.

It’s a serious discussion that includes deep dives into topics such as addiction, relationships, politics, and how we need to organize our internal and external lives to become the best versions of ourselves—for the sake of our own happiness and to better serve others.

Here, Jordan refers to the immensely powerful results that come from simply organizing one’s physical space and the ramifications it has on our internal landscape. He explains how this can cascade to positively impact our thinking, emotions, and behavior.

Our conversation is grounded in research data and practical tools that people of all ages and genders should find useful."

We discuss the biology of human emotions and motivations, healthy versus destructive impulses, addictions, and generative drives. Topics include how brain states shape decision-making—for better or worse—and how religion and culture can guide us toward and through the best paths in life. 

We also explore the innate human drive to create ""impact at a distance"" and how it influences social interactions, educational pursuits, career choices, and relationships. Additional subjects include morality, social media, politics, the human appetite for drama, and the importance of embracing responsibility as a form of adventure to avoid wasting time. 

Listeners will gain practical knowledge from psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and religion.

I explain how making errors triggers the release of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, which are essential for learning. I also discuss the differences between how neuroplasticity occurs in children and adults, focusing on the varying requirements and effort needed for learning. I discuss science-supported learning strategies for adults, including small practice bouts, leveraging frustration, regulating your autonomic state, and using movement to maximize focus and neuroplasticity.

6YLdlK2hYnw,Life Advice: What to Aim For,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YLdlK2hYnw,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2024-12-18T02:02:20Z,111061,6041,"My guest on the Huberman Lab episode out now is Dr. Bernardo Huberman. He is a physicist who immigrated to the United States to conduct research on particle physics, later transitioning to chaos theory before moving into computer science and quantum computing. As his last name suggests, he is also my father.

In this episode, we explore what it means to let curiosity guide major career decisions—the benefits, the risks, and the challenge of balancing career ambitions with everyday life.

The audio in this clip features his response to a question I asked during the podcast: “Do you have any wishes for me—[and for anyone wondering what to aspire to in life]?”

Our conversation also delves into topics like science, family, leaving a politically unstable country for the United States, social dynamics, patriotism, the tension between tradition and self-expression, and, of course, the relationship between parents and children—including why a bit of rebellion can foster personal growth when it serves a meaningful purpose.

This was obviously a deeply meaningful episode for me to record, given that Dr. Huberman is my father. I also believe the discussion will resonate broadly, particularly with those who frequently switch fields of interest—a journey Dr. Huberman has embraced repeatedly over more than five decades."

We discuss his journey into science, beginning in South America, how a curiosity about physics led him to the United States, and how his hunger for studying novel problems guided him into fields like physics, computer science, biology, economics, and, most recently, quantum computing. He explains relativity theory, chaos theory, fractals, and quantum internet in terms anyone can understand.  

We explore how curiosity has continually guided his decisions about what to study and how to live, and how researching hard, even abstract, problems can serve as a model for staying grounded and enjoying everyday life. We also discuss meditation, spirituality, and why continually asking questions about how the world is organized can bring about an immense and lasting sense of meaning and joy.

It covers what the peer-reviewed research says about exercise, nutrition, supplementation, and health. Here we are discussing if resistance training needs to be done ""to failure"" — the inability to further move the resistance in good form for that set. It turns out the answer is relevant if you are seeking hypertrophy and/or strength.

Keep in mind that resistance training has been recommended by numerous guests on the podcast for both women and men regardless of whether you're seeking hypertrophy, or simply strength increases. In fact, resistance training is turning out to be one of the best ways to improve your immediate and long-term health and longevity per se."

I discuss “temperature minimum” — a simple and reliable measurement that helps you quickly adjust to new time zones and counteract the negative effects of nocturnal shift work. I also provide actionable tools for regulating sleep and wake cycles in babies and new parents.  

The episode emphasizes the critical role of circadian rhythms, influenced by factors like light exposure, temperature regulation, and eating schedules. Practical tools include using light to shift your circadian clock, understanding the role of temperature in sleep, and adopting strategies to improve rest without medication. Whether you’re a shift worker, a parent of a newborn, or someone facing sleep challenges, this episode offers valuable guidance for enhancing recovery and overall well-being.

1SXDXdngX2M,"Why Venting Makes You & Others Feel Worse, Not Better",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SXDXdngX2M,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2024-12-02T20:01:50Z,59478,2904,"Ethan Kross, Ph.D. is a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Michigan and a world expert in researching “chatter” (the voice in our heads) and emotion regulation.

Many people believe that verbally venting — or venting via text — makes us feel better. However, the data show that while venting strengthens social bonds, it also makes both the complainer and the listener more unhappy and amplifies negative emotions for both parties. Essentially, venting is counterproductive if your goal is to feel better.

This is interesting, considering that nearly all of us are prone to venting to some degree.

Note: The data on journaling (covered in this and a previous Huberman Lab episode) strongly suggest that processing bad experiences doesn’t do much to relieve the associated negative emotions. There’s something intriguing about the differences between journaling to oneself and complaining or venting to others."
z5W74QC3v2I,Understand & Apply the Psychology of Money to Gain Greater Happiness | Morgan Housel,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5W74QC3v2I,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2024-12-02T13:01:19Z,763198,14024,"In this episode, my guest is Morgan Housel, an expert in private wealth generation and management and author of the bestselling book The Psychology of Money. We discuss how desiring, pursuing, saving, and spending money impact our psychology and perception of wealth. We explore why people tend to either overspend or oversave and examine the most common mistakes made in the pursuit of financial freedom. Additionally, we discuss how to best use money — and one’s relationship with it — as a tool to create psychological security, freedom, and a deeper sense of life purpose.

We also delve into the impact of purchases, social media, and wealth signaling on our internal reward circuits, the dangers of using money as a gauge of career progress or self-worth, and the healthiest psychological stances to adopt while building wealth at any level. By the end of the episode, listeners will have gained numerous practical tools for making smarter financial decisions and should have a clearer understanding of the role money plays in their psychology, happiness, and life.

We discuss how early child-parent interactions shape brain circuitry, impacting our ability to form attachments, manage emotions, and navigate conflict and stress. We cover how the development of right-brain circuitry related to emotional processing and the unconscious mind regulates physiological responses, influencing adult friendships and romantic relationships. We also explore how improving your ability to listen to the emotional tone—rather than just the meaning—of words is a vital skill for fostering better relationships with yourself and others, and how it plays a role in reshaping brain circuitry.

Additionally, we explain how circuits in the right brain hemisphere drive creativity and intuition and discuss activities to access the unconscious mind. This episode delves into how the unconscious mind regulates emotions—both your own and others’—and shapes our sense of self. By the end, you’ll have new knowledge and tools to build more secure, meaningful, and impactful connections of all kinds: professional, romantic, familial, friendships, and beyond.

Dr. Swan is the world’s leading expert on the harmful impact of chemicals in our food, water, cosmetics, and various household and consumer products on our hormones, and the consequences for fertility and overall reproductive health. She explains how exposure to phthalates and other endocrine disruptors adversely impacts fetal development, puberty, and the adult brain and body. We discuss the global decline in human fertility due to disruptive environmental toxins, such as pesticides, and certain foods and beverages we consume.

We discuss practical strategies to minimize exposure to harmful chemicals, such as phthalates, bisphenol A (BPA), BPS, and PFAS. This includes reducing disposable plastic use, making healthier food preparation, consumption, and storage choices, and selecting personal and household products that don’t contain harmful toxins. This episode allows you to assess your risk of exposure to endocrine disruptors accurately and empowers you to take control of your hormone health and fertility.

He specializes in identifying, reducing friction with, and disentangling from high-conflict individuals. We explain how high-conflict personalities differ from personality disorders and examine the cycles of blame and drama that cause persistent conflict in their relationships.

We discuss how to quickly recognize high-conflict individuals based on specific criteria and behaviors, helping listeners learn to spot their less obvious tactics. You’ll also learn how to disengage from them with minimal friction and understand the methods they use to draw people back in or keep conflict alive.

Additionally, we cover effective communication strategies for mediating situations involving high-conflict individuals, emphasizing empathy and problem-solving approaches. This episode equips listeners with tools to navigate conflict in various contexts, promoting resolutions that benefit all parties involved.

I provide practical strategies for limiting exposure to microplastics, nanoplastics, and endocrine disruptors such as bisphenol-A (BPA), bisphenol-S (BPS), phthalates, and PFAS (""forever chemicals""). Additionally, I discuss methods to enhance the body's detoxification and excretion of microplastics.

By the end of this episode, you will have a clear understanding of the modern science of microplastics and their impact on human biology, along with actionable steps to minimize exposure and accumulation in the brain and body.

We discuss the importance of learning to project our understanding of ourselves and our goals into the future, both for our own sake and for future generations. We also explore how this fosters a sense of unity and community within our species.

We examine how technology and modern society influence our perception of time and our ability to make decisions in a fast-paced, reward-driven environment that leads to our best possible future. Additionally, we discuss how the dismantling of traditional institutions has altered people's sense of purpose. We outline protocols to cultivate long-term thinking, connect with core values, and define a deep sense of purpose. This episode provides listeners with actionable tools to merge short- and long-term thinking in ways that create a positive, lasting impact on ourselves, society, and the planet.

We explore GLP-1 analogs for weight loss, BPC-157 for wound healing and reducing inflammation, as well as peptides that increase growth hormone, improve REM sleep, and enhance cognitive function. We also cover testosterone therapy, NAD, NMN, and NR supplementation, methylene blue for mitochondrial health, stem cell therapies, and supplements such as CoEnzyme Q10 and methylated B vitamins.

Additionally, we discuss effective dosages, sourcing, safety considerations, and the importance of working with knowledgeable physicians. Whether you're currently using peptides or exogenous hormones, or simply curious about their potential benefits and risks, this episode provides the scientific rationale behind how peptides function, their potential to enhance mental and physical health, and how they can optimize performance.

We discuss how memory works, what causes diseases of dementia like Alzheimer’s, and science-based strategies to reduce age-related cognitive decline. We also cover the essential role of curiosity and the dopamine-curiosity link that can assist memory formation and neuroplasticity.

We then discuss challenges with attention and focus, and how to overcome them, as well as how to manage task-switching and create home and work environments more conducive to cognitive health and longevity. Additionally, we explore the emotional aspect of memories, tools for overcoming rumination, and strategies for reframing past negative experiences.

This episode will be of interest to anyone seeking to improve and maintain their cognitive health, focus, and memory across their lifespan, as well as for those struggling with ADHD.

We explain why, as children, we are particularly vulnerable to PTSD and how stress and trauma affect the developing brain. We also discuss how PTSD is related to attention-deficient hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and vice versa.

Dr. Carrión shares effective therapeutic interventions for PTSD, including cue-centered therapy (CCT) and how to create a custom “toolbox” to help you identify triggers and manage stress. We discuss an emerging curriculum that combines yoga and mindfulness to help people with PTSD improve their stress resilience, mood, and sleep.

The episode will provide listeners of all ages with a clear understanding of PTSD and effective strategies to heal from it.

We discuss emotional intelligence and describe tools to improve emotional regulation and communication in personal and professional relationships. We also explore the role of emotions in learning, resolving conflicts, and decision-making. We also discuss bullying in kids and adults, both in person and online. This episode provides a clear and novel framework for thinking about emotions and data-supported tools to improve emotion regulation, self-awareness, and empathic attunement.

We discuss cynicism and its healthier, more adaptive alternative, healthy skepticism, and how embracing healthy skepticism can enhance both our emotional and physical health.

We discuss the data on how cynicism affects us as individuals and in relationships, causing lower levels of happiness, poorer physical health, and reduced creativity, trust, and collaboration. He also explains novel data-supported tools that we can use to shift ourselves towards a more informed yet more positive worldview and how to adopt a mindset of “hopeful skepticism” — the ideal stance to navigate life. 

Dr. Zaki offers listeners a positive, hopeful view of humanity grounded in cutting-edge research from his laboratory and other top laboratories. He also offers science-supported protocols to navigate relationships in person and online better.

I explain the neurobiology of learning and neuroplasticity and how correctly timed, self-directed test-taking can be leveraged to improve learning and prevent forgetting. 

I discuss the study habits of the most successful learners, ways to limit distractions, how to set study goals, and how tests can be used as tools to learn, not just as a means for evaluating one’s mastery of learned material. A surprising aspect of tests, specifically self-testing soon after exposure to new material, is that they can significantly improve your ability to learn, apply, and maintain new knowledge. I also discuss tools to improve focus and alertness while studying.

By the end of this episode, you will have learned various science-supported actionable tools you can use to better learn, remember, and apply new information.

We discuss science and clinically supported protocols to improve skin health and give your skin a more youthful appearance and structure, reducing premature aging and skin cancer risk.
 
We discuss the impact of sun exposure on skin appearance and aging and the surprising relationship between sun exposure and skin cancer. We explain how mineral-based (inorganic) sunscreens differ from chemical (organic) sunscreens, whether sunscreen can minimize premature skin aging, reduce cancer risk, and if there are any health risks associated with sunscreen use.
 
We discuss skincare routines to significantly improve skin appearance and how to select skincare products. We discuss how caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, and stress impact the skin and describe how nutrition and anti-inflammatory diets can improve skin health. We also discuss the causes and treatments for common skin conditions, including dandruff, acne, rosacea, eczema, psoriasis, and vitiligo.
 
Our conversation also covers topics such as the use of retinoids, laser treatments, red-light phototherapy, supplements, and how to best monitor for skin cancer. This episode provides numerous actionable protocols, most of which are zero-to-low cost, for improving skin health and appearance, reducing cancer risk, and treating skin problems.

We discuss how to evaluate scientific evidence and the validity of different practices aimed at achieving fat loss, muscle strength and hypertrophy, microbiome health, vitality, and longevity.

We explore many hotly debated topics, including fasting, seed oils, saturated fats, sugar, red meat, artificial/low-calorie sweeteners, and GLP-1 agonists (e.g., Ozempic). Additionally, we delve into the timing of protein and carbohydrate intake relative to fasting and exercise, fat loss and sleep, and the benefits of dietary protein and fiber on overall health.

We also discuss how to accelerate hypertrophy and fat loss, improve strength, whether we need to train to “failure,” how to enhance exercise recovery, and how to manage pain. We cover training before versus after age 50, whether metabolism changes with age, and the connection between muscle health and longevity. We also address why certain behaviors and supplements might work for some people but not others.

Listeners to this episode will benefit greatly from Layne’s science-based expertise on a wide range of topics, including health, nutrition, and fitness.

This episode is a recording of the live stream AMA, exclusive to our Premium members. We've decided to make the full-length version available to everyone, including non-members of Huberman Lab Premium.

Huberman Lab Premium was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the main Huberman Lab podcast — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation and other donors.

If you're not yet a member but enjoyed this full-length livestream AMA, we invite you to join Huberman Lab Premium. By subscribing, you'll gain access to exclusive benefits including our regular monthly full-length AMA episodes, AMA transcripts, podcast episode transcripts, early access to live events and more. Additionally, a significant portion of your membership proceeds contributes to advancing human scientific research.

Dr. Attia is also the host of The Drive podcast and author of the best-selling book Outlive. 

We discuss the NAD pathway in human cells and its possible links to aging and health. We evaluate how supplementation can augment molecules in the NAD pathway; we compare NAD, NMN, and NR, different routes of administration, their safety, and bioavailability. Then, we discuss the broader research and clinical literature on longevity to decide if supplementation with NAD, NR, NMN, rapamycin, or resveratrol can indeed extend lifespan. 

Finally, we each describe our supplement regimens and compare the role of supplementation to behaviors such as sleep, nutrition, and exercise for longevity. We also discuss whether tests of biological age are true indicators of aging and whether normal radiation levels increase cancer risk. 

Listeners of this episode will learn if supplements purported to improve lifespan show any efficacy and the behaviors and other factors that can prevent disease and extend lifespan.

We discuss which exercise and nutrition protocols are ideal for women based on their age and particular goals.

We discuss whether women should train fasted, when and what to eat pre- and post-training, and how the menstrual cycle impacts training and nutrition needs. We also explain how to use a combination of resistance, high-intensity, and sprint interval training to effectively improve body composition, hormones, and cardiometabolic health, offset cognitive decline, and promote longevity. 

We also discuss supplements and caffeine, the unique sleep needs of women based on age, whether women should use deliberate cold exposure, and how saunas can improve symptoms of hot flashes and benefit athletic performance. Dr. Sims challenges common misconceptions about women’s health and fitness and explains why certain types of cardio, caloric restriction, and low-protein diets can be harmful to women’s metabolic health.

Listeners will learn a wealth of actionable information on how to improve their training and nutrition to enhance their health and how to age with greater ability, mobility, and vitality.

We discuss the most common sources of back pain, how back pain can be assessed (including self-assessment techniques), and how to design a personalized recovery plan to reduce back pain. 

We discuss how to train for lifelong fitness, reduce injury risk, and protect your back and joints based on your age and personal goals. We also discuss how to prevent back pain, build core stability, and explain how “McGill’s Big 3” exercises protect and strengthen the back. Dr. McGill, who is exceptionally fit in his late 60s, describes his low-time investment, personal training routine, and the specific exercises he uses for mobility, strength, and cardiovascular fitness. 

We also discuss controversial issues in the back pain and rehabilitation field, including how pain originates, the biopsychosocial model of pain, and treatments such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP). This episode provides clear, actionable tools to strengthen, prevent, and remedy back pain and injury so you can be pain-free while enjoying sports, exercise, and daily activities at any age.

jouFvyRZntk,How Cannabis Impacts Health & the Potential Risks | Dr. Matthew Hill,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jouFvyRZntk,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2024-07-08T12:00:47Z,786283,12361,"In this episode, my guest is Dr. Matthew Hill, a professor of cell biology and anatomy at the Hotchkiss Brain Institute at the University of Calgary and an expert on the biology of cannabis. We discuss how cannabis affects the brain to produce its psychoactive effects (feeling “high”), including altered time perception, focus, memory, appetite, and stress.

We discuss how THC vs. cannabidiol (CBD) affects the brain, the effects of different routes of cannabis administration (e.g., smoking, vaping, edibles), high-potency THC, and whether cannabis is addictive. We discuss if there is a link between cannabis use and the development of psychosis, anxiety, bipolar depression, or schizophrenia. 

We discuss whether CBD has clinical benefits in regulating stress, promoting sleep, and treating certain diseases. We also discuss if there are real and consistent differences in the biological effects of different cannabis strains, if cannabis impacts hormones, and the uses of cannabis for the management of pain, stress, Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and nausea.

Listeners of this episode will get an up-to-date understanding of what is currently known about how cannabis affects the brain and body, including both its potential benefits and risks.

1CxJVdeyltw,How to Improve Skin Health & Appearance,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CxJVdeyltw,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2024-07-01T12:00:01Z,1271249,29053,"In this episode, I discuss skin health appearance and why both are important indicators of the health status of your immune system, gut microbiome, and other organ systems. I explain why sunlight is essential for skin and hormone health and how excessive sunlight can accelerate skin aging and cause certain skin cancers. I discuss the different types of sunscreens (physical, chemical, and mineral-based) and potential health concerns of the chemicals found in some (but not all) sunscreens.

I also discuss the importance of getting your skin (and not just moles) checked for pre-cancerous and cancer growths, the role of nutrition and lifestyle factors that improve skin health and appearance, and how to improve your skin by reducing local and systemic inflammation and supporting your microbiome. 

I explain what works to improve your skin's youthfulness and appearance, including reducing wrinkles, sagging, and pore size. I review the data on ingesting (or topically applied) collagen, vitamin C, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and retinol, and what is known about the use of peptides (e.g., BPC-157, copper peptides) and red and far-red light phototherapies for improving skin health and appearance.

I also discuss the causes of acne, rosacea, and psoriasis and explain nutritional, skin care, and prescription-based approaches to treating these common skin conditions. 

This episode ought to help everyone better understand the biology of the skin and help them make the best possible decisions for their skin health, care, and appearance according to age, goals, and current skin conditions.

7TkGDj4LaOU,Should You Intermittent Fast?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TkGDj4LaOU,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2024-06-26T03:55:25Z,286922,10533,"Time-restricted feeding is just one approach to regulating food intake that many people find useful for weight loss, but others find it less useful than simply caloric restriction across a “normal” meal distribution.

Of course, this is individual, but there are certain incentives to fasting that most people don’t consider. Dr. Gabrielle Lyon is the guest on the current Huberman Lab podcast, which is out now. She discusses some of the advantages of fasting as well as who should probably avoid fasting.

During the episode, we discuss protein intake and sources and specific types of training for men and women as it relates to physical health and longevity of the body and brain. There’s also an extensive discussion about nutrition and supplementation and a discussion of different types of training, as well as essential takeaways about mindset for building lasting vigor and health.

She is also an expert in how diet and exercise impact muscle and whole-body health and longevity. Dr. Lyon is a bestselling author and public educator. We discuss how healthy skeletal muscle promotes longevity, brain health, disease prevention, ideal body composition, and the health of other organs and bodily systems.

She makes specific nutritional recommendations for optimal health: what to eat, how much to eat, the timing of meals, the essential need for adequate quality protein (including animal and plant-based options), supplementation, and how our dietary requirements change with age. She explains why specific types of resistance training are essential to build and maintain muscle and overall metabolic health. She also describes how to include resistance training as part of your exercise regimen — regardless of age or sex. 

She also provides specific mindset tools to encourage sustained adherence to healthy eating and exercise practices. Women and men of all ages will benefit from Dr. Lyon’s practical, evidence-based protocols to improve muscle and whole-body appearance, function, and health.

C5KpIXjpzdY,The Science of Hunger & Medications to Combat Obesity | Dr. Zachary Knight,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5KpIXjpzdY,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2024-06-17T12:00:09Z,376617,8254,"In this episode, my guest is Dr. Zachary Knight, Ph.D., a professor of physiology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator. We discuss how the brain controls our sense of hunger, satiety, and thirst. He explains how dopamine levels impact our cravings and eating behavior (amount, food choices, etc) and how we develop and can change our food preferences and adjust how much we need to eat to feel satisfied. 
 
We discuss factors that have led to the recent rise in obesity, such as interactions between our genes and the environment and the role of processed foods and food combinations. We also discuss the new class of medications developed for the treatment of obesity and diabetes, including the GLP-1 agonists semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro). We discuss how these medications work to promote weight loss, the source of their side effects, and the newer compounds soon to overcome some of those side effects, such as muscle loss. 
 
Dr. Knight provides an exceptionally clear explanation for our sense of hunger, thirst, and food cravings that translates to practical knowledge to help listeners better understand their relationship to food, food choices, and meal size to improve their diet and overall health.

We discuss the dramatic rise of suicide, depression, and anxiety as a result of replacing a play-based childhood with smartphones, social media, and video games.
 
He explains how a screen-filled childhood leads to challenges in psychological development that negatively impact learning, resilience, identity, cooperation, and conflict resolution — all of which are crucial skills for future adult relationships and career success. We also discuss how phones and social media impact boys and girls differently and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of how smartphones alter basic brain plasticity and function. 
 
Dr. Haidt explains his four recommendations for healthier smartphone use in kids, and we discuss how to restore childhood independence and play in the current generation. 

This is an important topic for everyone, young or old, parents and teachers, students and families, to be aware of in order to understand the potential mental health toll of smartphone use and to apply tools to foster skill-building and reestablish healthy norms for our kids.

SZSRgyl7pyQ,The Science of Your Gut Sense & the Gut-Brain Axis | Dr. Diego Bohórquez,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZSRgyl7pyQ,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2024-05-27T12:00:32Z,368785,6989,"In this episode, my guest is Dr. Diego Bohórquez, PhD, professor of medicine and neurobiology at Duke University and a pioneering researcher into how we use our ‘gut sense.’ He describes how your gut communicates to your brain and the rest of your body through hormones and neural connections to shape your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. He explains how your gut senses a range of features such as temperature, pH, the macro- and micronutrients in our foods, and much more and signals that information to the brain to affect our food preferences, aversions, and cravings. 

Dr. Bohórquez describes his early life in the Amazon jungle and how exposure to traditional agriculture inspired his unique expertise combining nutrition, gastrointestinal physiology, and neuroscience. We discuss how the gut and brain integrate sensory cues, leading to our intuitive “gut sense” about food, people, and situations. This episode provides a scientific perspective into your gut sense to help you make better food choices and, indeed, to support better decision-making in all of life.

SyWC8ZFVxGo,How to Find Your True Purpose & Create Your Best Life | Dr. James Hollis,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyWC8ZFVxGo,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2024-05-13T12:00:26Z,2572968,40841,"In this episode, my guest is Dr. James Hollis, Ph.D., a Jungian psychoanalyst, renowned educator and author on finding and pursuing one’s unique purpose. Dr. Hollis is also an expert in the psychology of relationships and healing from trauma. We discuss how early family dynamics and social context create patterns of both adaptive and maladaptive behavior and internal narratives that, when examined, lead to better choices and a deeply fulfilling existence.

We discuss discovering your unique self-identity and purpose through specific practices of reflection, meditation and conversations with others. We also discuss self-perception and the evolution of roles within marriages, parent-child relationships, and work.

Throughout the episode, Dr. Hollis provides both basic knowledge and practical tools to help us assess ourselves and better understand who we are and what we really want in careers, relationships of all kinds, and society.

In this episode, we explain the connection between sleep and mood, emotional regulation and mental well-being. 

We explain the role of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in processing emotions and emotional memories and why sleep deprivation causes agitation, impulsivity and emotional reactivity. 

We also discuss why sleep disruption is a hallmark feature of PTSD, anxiety, depression, suicidality, and other psychiatric conditions. 

We explain protocols for improving REM sleep and other sleep phases in order to harness the therapeutic power of quality sleep to feel calmer and emotionally restored.

This episode describes various actionable tools to improve sleep for those struggling with mental health or mood and those wanting to bolster their overall state and well-being. 

The next episode in this special series explores dreams, including lucid dreaming, nightmares and dream interpretation.

Huberman Lab Premium was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the main Huberman Lab podcast  — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation. 

If you're an existing Premium member, you can log in to access the full episode at https://hubermanlab.supercast.com. 

If you're not a member, you can join Huberman Lab Premium at https://www.hubermanlab.com/premium to enjoy exclusive content, including monthly Ask Me Anything (AMA) episodes, AMA transcripts, podcast episode transcripts, early access to live events and help advance human scientific research.

PVmQOLYckKQ,Protocols to Strengthen & Pain Proof Your Back,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVmQOLYckKQ,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2024-04-29T12:00:19Z,415774,9686,"In this episode, I explain how to strengthen and build a stable, pain-free back and how to reduce or eliminate existing back pain. I explain the anatomy and physiology of the spinal cord and vertebrae, intervertebral disks and nerve pathways, and the abdominal and back muscles that together can be leveraged to stabilize the back. 

Then, I describe protocols: “McGill’s Big 3” exercises, a highly effective psoas stretch, abdominal stabilization, breathing techniques, and protocols to reinforce essential supports for the back, including the neck, pelvis, feet and toes. 

I also explain how you can reduce and potentially eliminate back pain and sciatica using a specific type of bar hang, “cobra push-ups,” medial-glute strengthening exercises and more. 

Back pain greatly impedes one’s ability to enjoy daily activities; this episode provides zero-cost, minimal time-investment protocols to improve your back strength and stability and allow you to move through life pain-free and with ease and mobility.

In this episode, we discuss the relationship between sleep, learning and creativity. 

We explain why and how sleep before and after a learning bout can improve memory and performance for both cognitive tasks and physical skills. We also discuss how to use time learning and sleep, how to use naps, non-sleep deep rest states, and caffeine to optimize learning, and the mechanisms for sleep and memory consolidation. 

We also explain the critical role that sleep plays in creativity and one's ability to discover novel solutions to challenges and problems. 

This episode is filled with actionable information on using sleep to enhance skill learning and improve memory and creativity. 

The next episode in this guest series explains how sleep benefits emotional regulation and mental health.

She is a professor of pediatrics and adolescent medicine and a developmental psychologist at Stanford University School of Medicine. Dr. Halpern-Felsher is a world expert in adolescent decision-making and risk-taking behaviors. 

She explains the huge increase in vaping (e-cigarettes) by young people. She explains why vaping nicotine and cannabis is particularly dangerous to the developing brain. We discuss the rise in vaping addiction, the unique social pressures and social media influences faced by youth that make quitting challenging, and interventions to aid them in quitting or reducing use. 

We also discuss the role of technology and social media. And, the use of alcohol, nicotine pouches, fentanyl, and other risky behaviors that adolescents face now. 

This episode should interest parents, teachers, coaches, teens, and families. It covers the current youth substance use landscape and also covers resources and ways to quit these addictive behaviors.

We explain how our sleep architecture changes as we age. We also cover how childhood development and aging affect sleep biology and needs. We also discuss whether polyphasic sleep (multiple short sleep periods) is beneficial. 

Then, we discuss naps, including their positive benefits, individual variability, those who should not nap, and alternative rest states like non-sleep deep rest. Dr. Walker shares protocols to optimize nap duration, timing and effectiveness.

We also explore the effects of caffeine on sleep and other health aspects, as well as the optimal timing for caffeine intake.

This episode describes many actionable science-based tools for optimizing sleep, naps and caffeine use for better health and performance.

The next episode in this special series explores the relationship between sleep, memory, and creativity.

Ky-ZJ9SS-x4,A Simple Solution for Quickly Returning to Sleep at Night,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ky-ZJ9SS-x4,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2024-04-12T14:08:17Z,770619,26317,"Dr. Matthew Walker explains one of the common issues people face: waking up in the middle of the night. That itself is not so much a problem if it just happens once per night, but often, people have difficulty falling back asleep, which then sets in motion anxiety about sleep, sleep deprivation, and, in turn, the negative effects of sleep deprivation.

Something as simple as looking at the time can create a cascade of issues, leading to more sleep challenges.

The takeaway: If you have trouble waking up in the middle of the night and difficulty falling back asleep afterward, consider removing all clock faces, electronic or otherwise, from the bedroom.

We discuss basic and advanced tools for improving sleep and explain how sleep quality is affected by temperature, light and dark, caffeine, alcohol, cannabis, nutrition, meal timing, and different medications. 

Dr. Walker also provides strategies for coping with a poor night of sleep, wind-down routines, technology in the bedroom, insomnia, visualizations, and building sleep “confidence.” 

We also discuss the current status of sleep research for developing advanced techniques to optimize sleep. 

This episode provides numerous zero-cost behavioral protocols for improving sleep quality and restorative power, which can benefit daytime mood, energy, performance, and overall health. 

The next episode in this special series explores napping, caffeine, and additional protocols to improve sleep.

We cover how sleep affects our hormones, immune system, learning and memory, mood, appetite, and weight regulation.

We also discuss what causes the urge to sleep, how sleep is structured throughout the night, and the biology of the different phases of sleep. We also teach you how to determine your individualized sleep needs, including your chronotype (best waking and to-bed time), tips for combat snoring and insomnia, and your QQRT (Quality, Quantity, Regularity, and Timing)—a key framework for optimizing your sleep and therefore daytime energy and focus, and overall health.

The next episode in this special series explores how to improve one’s sleep.

I discuss peptides for improving tissue rejuvenation and repair, promoting longevity, improving muscle growth and fat loss, and boosting mood, vitality, and libido. I explain the biology of how these peptides work and both their potential benefits and risks. I also discuss peptide sourcing, dosages, cycling, routes of administration, and how peptides work in combination. 

This episode will help you better understand the rapidly expanding landscape of peptide therapeutics and how to evaluate if specific peptides might be advantageous towards achieving your physical or mental health goals.

kpTJqwIfHcM,What Magic & Mind Reading Reveal About the Brain | Asi Wind,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpTJqwIfHcM,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2024-03-25T12:00:41Z,316394,6287,"In this episode, my guest is Asi Wind. He's one of the world’s top magicians and mentalists. 

We discuss what magic and mentalism reveal about the human mind, including how memories are made, how to erase them, and how and why we perceive things the way we do, all in the context of how he performs his astonishing tricks. 

Asi explains that magic works because it involves storytelling, which is key to how we organize memories. He also explains how emotional connection allows people to co-create and believe a common narrative, even one that did not actually occur. 

We also discuss how Asi's love of painting and photography and his specific daily routine allow him to access creativity. We also discuss fear, perfectionism, and how feeling emotions deeply serves his craft. 

Whether you are interested in magic or not, this conversation with Asi will give you an incredible window into how you perceive, learn, and remember the world around you and how what you believe may or may not be based in reality.

Chichilnisky, Ph.D., a professor of neurosurgery and ophthalmology at Stanford University. He studies how we see and uses that information to build artificial eyes that restore vision to the blind. 

We discuss how understanding the retina (the light-sensing brain tissue that lines the back of our eyes) is critical to knowing how our brain works more generally. 

We discuss brain augmentation with biologically informed prostheses, robotics, and AI and what this means for medicine and humanity. 

We also discuss E.J.’s unique journey into neuroscience and how changing fields multiple times, combined with some wandering, taught him how to guide his decision-making in all realms of life. 

This episode ought to be of interest to anyone interested in learning how the brain works from a world-class neuroscientist, those interested in the future of brain therapeutics and people seeking inspiration and tools for navigating their own professional and life journey.

I discuss how your beliefs and expectation that a certain outcome will occur after taking a substance (or any intervention cause genuine changes in brain and bodily function. I discuss how placebos can change neurotransmitter and hormone release, pain levels, whether the stress response is beneficial or detrimental and more. I also explain how placebo effects can work with traditional drug or behavioral treatments to help improve health outcomes and why some people are more susceptible to placebo effects. By the end of the episode, listeners will understand the placebo effect, how it works, and how beliefs and mindsets can be leveraged toward mental health, physical health, and performance goals.

This episode is a recording of a live stream AMA, originally exclusive to our Premium members. We've decided to make the full-length version available to everyone, including non-members of Huberman Lab Premium.

Huberman Lab Premium was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the main Huberman Lab podcast — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.

If you're not yet a member but enjoyed this full-length livestream AMA, we invite you to join Huberman Lab Premium at https://www.hubermanlab.com/premium. By subscribing, you'll gain access to exclusive benefits including our regular monthly full-length AMA episodes, AMA transcripts, podcast episode transcripts, early access to live events and more. Additionally, a significant portion of your membership proceeds contributes to advancing human scientific research. You can learn more about the research we were able to support in our Annual Letter 2023: https://www.hubermanlab.com/annual-letter/2023.

If you're a Huberman Lab Premium member, you can access the transcript for this AMA episode here: https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/ama-16-sleep-vertigo-tbi-ocd-tips-for-travelers-gut-brain-axis-more

XT_6Lvkhxvo,Protocols for Excellent Parenting & Improving Relationships of All Kinds | Dr. Becky Kennedy,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT_6Lvkhxvo,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2024-02-26T13:00:24Z,1743607,24767,"In this episode, my guest is Dr. Becky Kennedy, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist, bestselling author, and founder of Good Inside, an education platform for parents and parents-to-be. We discuss actionable protocols for raising resilient, emotionally healthy kids and effective alternatives to typical forms of reward and punishment that instead teach children valuable skills and strengthen the parent-child bond. These protocols also apply to other types of relationships: professional, romantic, friendships, siblings, etc. 

We explain how to respond to emotional outbursts, rudeness, and entitlement, repair fractured relationships, build self-confidence, and improve interpersonal connections with empathy while maintaining healthy boundaries. 

We also discuss how to effectively communicate with children and adults with ADHD, anxiety, learning challenges, or with “deeply feeling” individuals. 

The conversation is broadly applicable to all types of social interactions and bonds. By the end of the episode, you will have learned simple yet powerful tools to build healthy relationships with kids, teens, adults, and oneself.

We discuss the brain mechanisms underlying cognition and the forms of memory required for focus, productivity, planning and achieving goals, and learning. We discuss neurochemicals such as dopamine and acetylcholine and how they can be leveraged to improve cognitive functioning. We also discuss concussion, traumatic brain injury (TBI), Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease, and ways to restore or slow cognitive decline by using pharmacologic, lifestyle and behavioral protocols. This episode provides a modern understanding of cognition and memory and actionable tools to optimize brain health and function.

QpoaNklmRPc,Oral Health Protocols,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpoaNklmRPc,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2024-02-13T22:01:07Z,1352290,58331,"Dubbed by ElevenLabs

The new Huberman Lab episode is all about oral health. It covers everything from brushing and flossing, as well as how to repair cavities without drilling (which depends on how deep they are into the tooth, of course), as well as the oral microbiome, which is critical for whole body health, gum health, the legitimate concerns of being a mouth breather, especially during sleep, and much more.

Researching this episode has led me to significantly revamp my oral health protocols. The good news is all of them are easy, take a limited amount of time, and are either zero cost or will save you costs.

Many of the suggested protocols from experts are counterintuitive. The field of oral health has undergone significant strides in recent years, and the episode reflects the latest.

I explain science-supported protocols for strengthening your teeth and gums, including how to remineralize your teeth. I cover the best approaches and timing for brushing and flossing, tongue, gum, and oral microbiome care and how oral health is critically important to offset metabolic, cardiac, and brain diseases, including dementia. I also discuss proper nutrition for oral health, fluoride, and how sugar and mouth breathing can accelerate tooth decay. This episode ought to be of interest to everyone seeking to improve their physical health, mental health, and lifespan, given the critical role that oral health plays in all of these.

We discuss the neural circuit basis of social interactions and loneliness. We also discuss how animals and people establish themselves in a group hierarchy by rank and how the brain responds to dominance and subordination. 

Much of our discussion relates to how social media impacts our sense of social connectedness or lack thereof. The topics covered in this episode are directly relevant to anyone interested in the neuroscience of mental health, work-life balance, abundance versus scarcity mindset, and interpersonal dynamics.

Huberman Lab Premium was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the main Huberman Lab podcast  — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation. 

If you're an existing Premium member, you can log in to access the full episode at https://hubermanlab.supercast.com. 

If you're not a member, you can join Huberman Lab Premium at https://www.hubermanlab.com/premium to enjoy exclusive content, including monthly Ask Me Anything (AMA) episodes, AMA transcripts, podcast episode transcripts, early access to live events and help advance human scientific research.

I explain the key role of dopamine and the biological mechanisms underlying working memory and how working memory differs from both short- and long-term memory.

I also describe science-supported tools to enhance working memory and attention—including zero- or low-cost behavioral, supplemental and pharmacologic approaches. I include how to assess your working memory and how to use memory tasks to determine your baseline dopamine levels in certain brain circuits.

This episode provides listeners with highly actionable tools to assess and improve their attention to specific tasks and task-switching capacity and to enhance their overall productivity.

TG8VM5-CTfw,Journal Club with Dr. Peter Attia | Effects of Light & Dark on Mental Health & Treatments for Cancer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG8VM5-CTfw,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2024-01-22T13:00:32Z,241166,4925,"In this journal club episode, my guest is Dr. Peter Attia, M.D., a Stanford and Johns Hopkins-trained physician focusing on healthspan and lifespan and the host of The Drive podcast. 

We each present a peer-reviewed scientific paper chosen because it contains novel, interesting, and actionable data. First, we discuss a paper on how bright light exposure at sunrise and throughout the day and dark exposure at night independently improve mental health and can offset some of the major symptoms of mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety. Then, we discuss an article that explores a novel class of immunotherapy treatments to combat cancer. We also discuss some of the new data on low-calorie sweeteners and if they are safe. This episode should be of interest to listeners curious about maximizing their vitality and longevity and to anyone seeking science-supported ways to improve mental health and lifespan.

CuzL1qxUyHw,David Goggins on Controlling the Multi-Voice Dialogue in Your Mind,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuzL1qxUyHw,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2024-01-09T18:05:07Z,220418,14843,"This is an excerpt from the Huberman Lab episode with David Goggins.

It’s a brutally direct, mechanistic, and actionable discussion about how to embrace, confront, and control the dialogue in your mind — paying specific attention to the negative voices as a way to transmute all that into successful real-world behavior. Daily.

One thing is made clear: there is no way to avoid internal agony if your goal is to be the ultimate version of yourself.

The good news is that anyone can do it, but it requires going inward. Over and over again. David explains how.

He also explains how people get distracted by the observable things in others — choosing to point their fingers at others, criticize, focus on hacks, etc, as a way to avoid doing the real internal work for themselves.

The episode is a roadmap anyone can apply to better themselves, but only if they are willing to embrace the full reality of their deepest self-doubts, fears, shame, and darkness. As David explains, that’s the basement and the place from where true growth starts.

I describe behavior, nutrition and supplementation-based tools supported by peer-reviewed research to enhance immune system function and better combat colds and flu. I also dispel common myths about how the cold and flu are transmitted and when you and those around you are contagious. 

I explain if common preventatives and treatments such as vitamin C, zinc, vitamin D and echinacea work. I also highlight other compounds known to reduce contracting and duration of colds and flu. 

I discuss how to use exercise and sauna to bolster the immune response. 

This episode will help listeners understand how to reduce the chances of catching a cold or flu and help people recover more quickly from and prevent the spread of colds and flu.

Correction: I misspoke in the episode. A micron is 1/10,000 of a centimeter, not 1,000. Additionally, 1 millimeter equals 1/10 of a centimeter, not 1/100.

David explains how he mastered his inner dialogue to build extraordinary levels of discipline and mental and physical toughness.

He describes how confronting his early hardships, including physical and mental abuse, learning disorders, and obesity, became a practice of deep and excruciating self-reflection — eventually allowing him to transmute those experiences into a superhuman work ethic.

This conversation is a unique window into David Goggins’ process in that it focuses both on the underlying science and how David manages and directs his inner dialogue.

It’s a conversation that will inform and inspire anyone wondering how exactly to go about building discipline and confidence and reach their potential.

n28W4AmvMDE,How Sugar & Processed Foods Impact Your Health | Dr. Robert Lustig,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n28W4AmvMDE,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2023-12-18T13:00:39Z,4782213,62696,"In this episode, my guest is Dr. Robert Lustig, M.D., neuroendocrinologist, professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and a bestselling author on nutrition and metabolic health. We address the “calories in- calories out” (CICO) model of metabolism and weight regulation and how specific macronutrients (protein, fat, carbohydrates), fiber and sugar can modify the CICO equation. We cover how different types of sugars, specifically fructose, sugars found in liquid form, taste intensity, and other factors impact insulin levels, liver, kidney, and metabolic health. We also explore how fructose in non-fruit sources can be addictive (acting similarly to drugs of abuse) and how sugar alters brain circuits related to food cravings and satisfaction. We discuss the role of sugar in childhood and adult obesity, gut health and disease and mental health. We also discuss how the food industry uses refined sugars to create pseudo foods and what these do to the brain and body. This episode is replete with actionable information about sugar and metabolism, weight control, brain health and body composition. It ought to be of interest to anyone seeking to understand how specific food choices impact the immediate and long-term health of the brain and body.

We discuss how to find, pursue and achieve one’s unique life purpose, and how to best learn from good and hard experiences along that journey. We discuss power dynamics in relationships, the different types of human communication and the interplay between seduction and vulnerability. We discuss how to find the right romantic partner, improve healthy self-awareness, the link between anxiety and creativity, and pick ideal mentors and role models. Robert also discusses his recent stroke and what he has learned from his near-death experience about motivation, urgency and appreciation for life. Listeners of all ages will benefit from Robert’s insights on navigating the process of building a deeply purposeful life and enhancing one’s relationship with the self, others and society.

Huberman Lab Premium was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the main Huberman Lab podcast  — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation. 

If you're an existing Premium member, you can log in to access the full episode at https://hubermanlab.supercast.com. 

If you're not a member, you can join Huberman Lab Premium at https://www.hubermanlab.com/premium to enjoy exclusive content, including monthly Ask Me Anything (AMA) episodes, AMA transcripts, podcast episode transcripts, early access to live events and help advance human scientific research.

wG3UFHR1o48,How to Stop Hiccups Using a Science-Supported Tool,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG3UFHR1o48,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2023-11-27T23:29:57Z,603275,28737,"Dubbed by ElevenLabs

In this excerpt from the Huberman Lab episode ""How to Breathe Correctly for Optimal Health, Mood, Learning & Performance,"" I explain how to stop hiccups using a science-supported tool. Hiccups are caused by spasming of the phrenic nerve to diaphragm connection. Based on the way the phrenic nerve controls the diaphragm, you can stop that spasm by inhaling three times in a row with no exhales in between, then holding your breath for 15 to 30 seconds, and then slowly exhaling. 

Done correctly, this should eliminate hiccups the first time and every time, but if it's a severe spasm, you may have to repeat it a few times. All the other purported methods out there, such as drinking a glass of water backward, upside down, or scaring someone, etc., are all designed to adjust the pattern of diaphragmatic control by the brain. The technique described here actually does that.

He is also an avid public educator, having written five bestselling books, delivered several top-ranking TED Talks and is the host of two psychology podcasts. We discuss how to overcome procrastination, how to increase intrinsic motivation (even for dreaded tasks), identify blind spots and rethink our assumptions, and how we can build a persistent growth mindset. We also explain tools to improve creativity and discuss the surprising relationship between creativity and procrastination. We then explore how to effectively solicit useful feedback and grow from constructive criticism and how you can improve your level of focus and attention using science-supported methods. We also discuss mental tools to get out of negative thought spirals, how to nurture potential in yourself or others, and the dark side of perfectionism. The discussion delivers more than a dozen science-supported protocols that are readily applicable to anyone seeking to live a more productive, fulfilling, and creative life.

I explain how to implement this specific protocol, which takes only four days and 15-30 minutes per day. I also explain the mechanism for how the four-day writing protocol affects neuroplasticity (brain rewiring) and brain function in the short and long term. I explain how these brain changes positively impact our physical health, including our system's immune function and thus our ability to combat infections, improve sleep, reduce feelings of physical and emotional pain, lower anxiety, and bring about healing from traumas. This episode ought to be of interest to anyone seeking better mental and/or physical health through the use of brief yet highly effective science-supported protocols.

W5zqC5cYcS0,How Tone of Voice Shapes Emotional State of Listeners,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5zqC5cYcS0,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2023-11-14T21:36:41Z,3925730,215054,"In a recent Huberman Lab episode, my guest was Chris Voss, a former FBI hostage negotiator. During the episode, we discuss how the tone of speaking voice shapes the emotional tone of an entire conversation and why a low-frequency, calm voice creates a calm state in the listener and a calm, rational conversation.

Regardless of whether your voice is high or low or somewhere in between, this information can be applied to have more effective conversations of all kinds.

It all boils down to how the neurons in the auditory cortex respond to low-frequency sounds — they essentially create a low-frequency oscillation pattern within the listener.

The episode also focuses on how to detect lies, the essential features of benevolent negotiations and more.

We discuss female hormones, nutrition, supplementation, reproductive health, and fertility, including how the timing and duration of puberty impact a woman’s long-term hormone cycles and menopause. We also discuss the pros and cons of various birth control methods and how hormonal vs. non-hormonal birth control each affects fertility. We cover the factors that impact egg and sperm quality and how to leverage timing for conception. We also discuss procedures to assess female fertility, including egg count and hormone testing, the process of egg freezing, in vitro fertilization (IVF) and other reproductive options. This episode represents fairly comprehensive coverage of female hormones and reproductive health, highlighting important tests and screening, behavioral, nutritional, supplement and prescription-based tools that women of any age can use to improve their fertility, hormone function and overall health.

The Huberman Lab Premium subscription was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research.

CJIXbibQ0jI,Mental Health Toolkit: Tools to Bolster Your Mood & Mental Health,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJIXbibQ0jI,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2023-10-30T12:00:11Z,565213,12980,"In this episode, I provide science-based tools and protocols to improve mood and mental health. These tools represent key takeaways from several recently published research studies, as well as from former Huberman Lab guests Lisa Feldman Barrett, Ph.D., an expert in the science of emotions, and Paul Conti, M.D., a psychiatrist with vast clinical expertise in helping people overcome mental health challenges. I explain the first principles of self-care, which include the “Big 6” core pillars for mood and mental health. Those ensure our physiology is primed for our overall feelings of well-being. Then, I explain science-based tools to directly increase confidence, build a stronger concept of self, better understand our unconscious mind, manage stress and improve our emotional tone and processing. I also explain ways to better process negative emotions and traumas. This episode ought to be of interest to anyone wishing to improve their relationship with themselves and others, elevate their mood and mental health, and better contribute to the world in meaningful ways.

She explains what emotions are and how the brain represents and integrates signals from our body and the environment to create our unique emotional states. We discuss the relationship between emotions and language, how the specificity of language impacts emotional processing, the role of facial expressions in emotions and how emotions relate to sleep, movement, nutrition and the building and reinforcement of social bonds. We also share actionable tools to regulate feelings of uncertainty and to better understand the emotional states of others. This episode will interest anyone curious about the neuroscience and psychology underlying emotions and those who seek to better understand themselves and relate to others and the world in richer, more adaptive ways.

I discuss whether willpower is a limited resource, the controversial “ego depletion” theory of willpower and the role that beliefs play in determining our tenacity and willpower. Then I discuss the neural basis of willpower in the brain and body and how tenacity and willpower relate to sleep, stress, focus and possibly to lifespan. Then, I provide a series of science-supported tools and protocols to increase your level of tenacity and willpower.

The Huberman Lab Premium subscription was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.

yOJvm_ri_hk,Dr. Paul Conti: Tools and Protocols for Mental Health | Huberman Lab Guest Series,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOJvm_ri_hk,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2023-09-27T12:00:51Z,446774,7637,"This is episode 4 of a 4-part special series on mental health with Stanford and Harvard-trained psychiatrist Dr. Paul Conti, M.D. Dr. Conti explains what true self-care is and how our mental health benefits from specific self-care and introspection practices — much in the same way that our physical health benefits from certain exercise and nutrition habits. He describes how the foundation of mental health is an understanding of one’s own mind and the specific questions to ask in order to explore the conscious and unconscious parts of ourselves. He describes how this process can be done either on our own, through journaling, meditation and structured thought, or in therapy with the help of a licensed professional. He also explains how unprocessed trauma can short-circuit the process and how to prevent that, and the role of friendships and other relational support systems in the journey of self-exploration for mental health. People of all ages and those with and without self-introspection and therapy experience ought to benefit from the information in this episode.

We discuss nutrition, food additives, social media and mental health, public health initiatives to combat the crisis of social isolation, the obesity crisis, addiction and other pressing issues in public health. Dr. Murthy explains the role of the U.S. government in promoting specific public health issues and the steps needed to rebuild public trust in scientific and medical information. We also address health care accessibility, insurance barriers and individual versus team-based medical care, along with topics gleaned from listener questions, such as the facts and myths about the “Big Pharma” and “Big Food” industries, scientific research and public health policies.

He is the author of the book, “Trauma: The Invisible Epidemic.” Dr. Conti explains how to find, develop and strengthen healthy relationships — including romantic relationships, work and colleague relationships, and friendships. He explains a roadmap of the conscious and unconscious mind that can allow anyone to navigate conflicts better and set healthy boundaries in relationships. We also discuss common features of unhealthy relationships and clinically supported tools for dealing with relationship insecurity, excessive anxiety, past traumas, manipulation and abuse. Dr. Conti explains how, in healthy relationships, there emerges a dynamic of the mutually generative “us” and how to continually improve that dynamic. The next episode in this special series explores true self-care, which can be cultivated through a process of building self-awareness along with other important practices.

I explain the data showing how music can increase motivation for cognitive or physical work, what specific music has been shown to enhance cognitive performance, and whether silence or music is more effective in enhancing focus while studying. I also discuss how specific musical pieces can rapidly reduce anxiety, as well as certain prescription medications. I explain how listening to certain types of music can improve various health metrics (e.g., heart rate). Finally, I discuss how music helps to enhance neuroplasticity (rewiring of brain connections), thereby improving learning and memory. Whether you sing, play an instrument or enjoy listening to music, this episode provides numerous science-informed tools for using music to enhance productivity, mood, emotional states, and overall enjoyment of life.

Dr. Conti explains specific tools for how to overcome life’s challenges using a framework of self-inquiry that explores all the key elements of self, including defense mechanisms, behaviors, self-awareness and attention. We also discuss our internal driving forces, how to align them and ultimately, how to cultivate a powerful “generative drive” of positive, aspirational pursuits. Dr. Conti also explains how to adjust your internal narratives, reduce self-limiting concepts, overcome intrusive thoughts, and how certain defense mechanisms, such as “acting out” or narcissism, show up in ourselves and others. The next episode in this special series explores how to build healthy relationships with others.

We each present a scientific paper and discuss the findings' strengths, weaknesses and actionable takeaways.

First, we discuss an article that addresses whether taking the drug metformin can enhance longevity. Then, we discuss an article on belief effects (similar to placebo effects), showing how the effects of a drug on the brain and cognition depend on one's belief about the dose of the drug taken, not the actual dose.

Our conversation also highlights how to read, interpret and critique scientific studies. This episode ought to be of interest to those curious about health and longevity, medicine and psychology and for anyone seeking to better understand how to read and digest scientific findings.

tLRCS48Ens4,Dr. Paul Conti: How to Understand & Assess Your Mental Health | Huberman Lab Guest Series,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLRCS48Ens4,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2023-09-06T12:00:50Z,14679408,84295,"This is episode 1 of a 4-part special series on mental health with psychiatrist Dr. Paul Conti, M.D., who trained at Stanford School of Medicine and completed his residency at Harvard Medical School before founding his clinical practice, the Pacific Premiere Group.

Dr. Conti defines mental health in actionable terms and describes the foundational elements of the self, including the structure and function of the unconscious and conscious mind, which give rise to all our thoughts, behaviors, and emotions. He also explains how to explore and address the root causes of anxiety, low confidence, negative internal narratives, and over-thinking, as well as how our unconscious defense mechanisms operate.

This episode provides a foundational roadmap to assess your sense of self and mental health. It offers tools to reshape negative emotions, thought patterns, and behaviors — either through self-exploration or with a licensed professional.

The subsequent three episodes in this special series explore additional tools to further understand and improve your mental health.

We discuss what it takes to be a true innovator, including the personality traits required, the role of environment and the support systems needed to bring revolutionary ideas to fruition. We discuss risk-taking as a necessary but potentially hazardous trait, as well as the role of intrinsic motivation and one’s ability to navigate uncertainty. We also discuss artificial intelligence (AI) and Marc’s stance that soon everyone will use AI as their personalized coach and guide for making decisions about their health, relationships, finances and more — all of which he believes will greatly enhance our quality of life. We also delve into nuclear power, gene editing, public trust, universities, politics and AI regulation. This episode is for those interested in the innovative mind, psychology, human behavior, technology, culture and politics.

The Huberman Lab Premium subscription was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.

We discuss individual differences between people, focusing on how they sense the world around them and the roles that chance, heredity and life experiences (even in utero) play in determining physical and cognitive traits. We examine the bidirectional connection between the mind and body and how thoughts and mental practices (e.g., meditation and breathwork) impact health. We also explore the link between inflammation and depression. Dr. Linden shares his terminal illness diagnosis, his mindset during chemotherapy and what the diagnosis has taught him about the mind, gratitude, time perception and life. This episode also covers sensual touch, cerebellar function and epigenetic inheritance and will interest anyone in neuroscience, genetics, psychology and human development.

Rxmv7rT9leo,"Ketamine: Benefits and Risks for Depression, PTSD & Neuroplasticity | Huberman Lab Podcast",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rxmv7rT9leo,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2023-08-07T12:00:31Z,554381,11713,"In this episode, I explain how ketamine causes rewiring of brain circuits and dissociative states to relieve symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). I explain how ketamine impacts both the brain’s glutamate and its endogenous opioid pathways, which together regulate mood and well-being. I discuss how ketamine therapy is used clinically to treat major depression, bipolar depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), suicidality and other psychiatric challenges. I also describe how ketamine causes the subjective effects of dissociation and euphoria and, at higher doses, is an anesthetic. I compare the different routes of ketamine administration, dosages and forms of ketamine, and if micro-dosing ketamine is effective. I also highlight the potential risks of recreational ketamine use (and the colloquial term ‘K-holes’). This episode should interest anyone interested in ketamine, treatments for depression, neuroplasticity mechanisms, psychiatry and mental health.

I also discuss how our internal narratives drive our ability to make progress. I contrast the growth mindset vs. the fixed mindset and describe how the type of feedback or praise we receive shapes our mindsets, and the huge advantage of rewarding and celebrating “verbs” (actions) rather than adjectives (performance labels). I also discuss data showing how stress can enhance performance and explain why the growth mindset works synergistically with the “stress-is-enhancing mindset,” and how to combine them. Whether you are a student, coach, therapist, parent, teacher or simply someone seeking to improve at something, this episode provides numerous science-supported tools for how to adopt a performance enhancing mindset.

We discuss the brain’s reward systems involving dopamine and serotonin and how they motivate us to seek out specific behaviors and substances. We discuss how these reward systems are modified based on context and our memories and how they can be hijacked toward maladaptive drug-seeking in addiction. We also explore how reward systems influence social connections, oxytocin and empathy and how that applies to our understanding of autism spectrum disorders. This episode should be of interest to those interested in neuroplasticity, social bonding, addiction, autism, learning and motivation.

LYYyQcAJZfk,Science-Supported Tools to Accelerate Your Fitness Goals,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYYyQcAJZfk,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2023-07-03T12:00:13Z,744436,15772,"In this episode, I explain a set of fitness tools gleaned from the 6-part guest series on fitness, exercise and performance with Dr. Andy Galpin. First, I explain the essential components of a well-rounded fitness program for lifelong health and performance including the minimum requirements for progressive resistance and cardiovascular training. Then, I discuss 12 valuable science-supported fitness tools that take a small amount of time to implement, yet all of which can greatly enhance your level of fitness. These include short endurance-enhancing and strength and hypertrophy-enhancing tools, as well as psychological, respiration (breathing), nutrition and supplementation-based tools — all of which will improve your fitness in meaningful ways and can be easily layered into existing exercise programs to improve your fitness and performance outcomes.

His clinical and research efforts focus on retinal and optic nerve diseases such as glaucoma and on discovering stem cell and nanotechnology treatments to cure blindness. We discuss how to maintain and improve eye health throughout life; the advantages and disadvantages of corrective lenses, including whether you should wear “readers”; the use and risks of contact lenses; considerations for LASIK eye surgery; floaters; dry eye; the importance of sunlight and UV protection; and specific exercises to improve eye and vision health. Dr. Goldberg also explains age-related conditions—cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy—and the behavioral, supplementation-based, prescription and surgical tools used to promote eye health. This episode provides essential tools for listeners of any age and background to maintain eye health and offset vision loss.

The Huberman Lab Premium subscription was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.

We discuss Tim’s process of exploration, experimentation and mastery — themes that have spanned his career and placed him on the cutting edge of many important fields. Tim explains what questions to ask when approaching any new endeavor in order to maximize success. He also explains how to incorporate structure and playfulness into skill and knowledge mastery; how to find and work with mentors; and the key importance of location and networks in creating truly impactful things. We also discuss Tim’s philanthropic efforts to support research on psychedelics for the treatment of mental health challenges, and we discuss his latest creative endeavors. This episode should be of interest to a wide range of listeners as Tim’s mastery and wisdom spans athletic and mental pursuits, business, media, technology and the arts. What distinguishes Tim is his ability to thoughtfully deconstruct these processes in order to teach others how to do the same.

slUCmZJDXrk,The Science of MDMA & Its Therapeutic Uses: Benefits & Risks | Huberman Lab Podcast,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slUCmZJDXrk,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2023-06-12T12:00:47Z,444367,8214,"In this episode, I discuss methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), which is also commonly known as “ecstasy” or “molly,” including how it works in the brain to cause short- and long- term-shifts in emotional processing and its clinical applications for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alcohol and other substance-use addictions. I discuss the neuronal mechanisms for how MDMA elevates mood, empathy, motivation, social engagement, and reduces “threat detection” and how these effects can synergistically support talk therapy. I also explain the ongoing debate about the potential neurotoxicity of MDMA, myths about the origins and treatments for post-MDMA “crash,” the evolving legal landscape around MDMA use for clinical purposes, and I caution recreational users about the extremely dangerous additives (e.g., fentanyl) now commonly found in black market MDMA. This should be of interest to those curious about MDMA, neuropharmacology, the origins of emotional processing in the brain, empathy, PTDS, neuroplasticity, mental health and psychiatry.

She has done groundbreaking research on emotions, self-awareness and social interactions, and how these impact the way we learn and change across our lifespan. She explains how an understanding of emotions can be leveraged to improve learning in children and adults, and how the education system should be altered to include new forms of exploration, facilitate better learning and incorporate more diverse learning (and teaching) styles. This episode ought to be of interest to anyone interested in how we learn and human development in children and adults, as well as those generally interested in education, psychology or neuroscience.

I explain the brain circuits involved in focus and the key roles dopamine and norepinephrine play in their regulation. Then I explain how stimulants such as Adderall and Vyvanse can increase focus and reduce hyperactivity in kids or adults with ADHD, and how and why Ritalin and other medications (e.g., Modafinil, Guanfacine) may work better for some. I explain the long-term effects of ADHD medications on height, cardiovascular health, hormones, predisposition to addiction and psychosis, and whether these treatments can be used and then stopped. I also discuss the immense individual variation in dosage sensitivity for these medications and the negative side-effects that occur from recreational use. This episode ought to benefit anyone with ADHD, their parents, those on ADHD medications or anyone curious about how these medications work.

fcxjwA4C4Cw,The Science of Psychedelics for Mental Health | Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcxjwA4C4Cw,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2023-05-22T12:00:34Z,758462,12726,"In this episode, my guest is Robin Carhart-Harris, PhD, distinguished professor of neurology and psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco. He is one of the leading researchers studying how psychedelics such as psilocybin, LSD and DMT can change the human brain and, in doing so, be used to successfully treat various mental health challenges such as major depression, anorexia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and addiction. He explains how psilocybin induces sustained changes in adaptive brain wiring and cognition.

We discuss the key components of safe and effective psychedelic journeys, the role of hallucinations, the use of eye masks to encourage people to “go internal” and music, as well as what effective therapist support consists of before, during and after the session (also known as integration). We explore microdosing versus macrodosing and how researchers control for placebo effects in psychedelic research. We also examine the current legal landscape surrounding psychedelic therapies. Psychedelic therapies are fast emerging as powerful and soon-to-be mainstream treatments for mental health disorders, but they are not without risk. As such, this episode ought to be of use to anyone interested in brain plasticity, mental health, psychology or neuroscience.

She earned her doctoral degree at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, where she researched the effects of deliberate cold and heat exposure on metabolism and other aspects of human physiology. We discuss how cold exposure or sauna use can improve metabolism, cardiovascular and brain health, balance hormones and decrease inflammation. Dr Søberg explains how deliberate cold protocols can improve glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity and trigger the release of neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine, which enhance energy, mood and focus. We compare cold showers and cold immersion, traditional and infrared saunas and other variables. This episode provides actionable tools and answers to common questions about the use of deliberate cold and heat to improve health.

I discuss the emerging clinical trial evidence for the use of psilocybin in the treatment of depression, addictions and other psychiatric challenges. I explain the typical duration and phases of a psilocybin journey, the different categories of dosages often used and I explain the importance of set, setting and support when using psychedelics. I explain which groups of people place themselves at great risk by taking psilocybin as well as groups that could benefit, and I highlight the rapidly changing legal and medical landscape around psilocybin. This episode is a thorough exploration of psilocybin from the scientific and clinical literature perspective and ought to be of interest to anyone curious about psilocybin, mental health, neuroplasticity and/or psychedelics more generally.

cS7cNaBrkxo,"How Smells Influence Our Hormones, Health & Behavior | Dr. Noam Sobel",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cS7cNaBrkxo,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2023-05-01T12:00:33Z,3575787,19841,"In this episode, my guest is Noam Sobel, PhD, professor of neurobiology in the Department of Brain Sciences at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Dr. Sobel explains his lab’s research on the biological mechanisms of smell (“olfaction”) and how sensing odorants and chemicals in our environment impacts human behavior, cognition, social connections and hormones. He explains how smell is a crucial component of “social sensing” and how we use olfaction when meeting new people to determine things about their physiology and psychology, and he explains how this impacts friendships and romantic partners. He explains how smell influences emotions, hormone levels, memories and the relationship between breathing and autonomic homeostasis. He describes how smell-based screening tests can aid disease diagnosis and explains his lab’s work on digitization of smell — which may soon allow online communication to include “sending of odors” via the internet. Dr. Sobel’s work illustrates how sensitive human olfaction is and how it drives much of our biology and behavior.

0RYyQRQFgFk,Science-Based Mental Training & Visualization for Improved Learning | Huberman Lab Podcast,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RYyQRQFgFk,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2023-04-24T12:00:00Z,1033004,21226,"In this episode, I explore the science of mental visualization and its application for learning motor and cognitive skills. I discuss neuroplasticity-based skill development and the roles of focus, sleep, movement restriction, and agitation. I then present five key principles of mental visualization to enhance learning speed, accuracy, and consistency. I also provide examples of specific protocols, including repetitions, rest periods, and session frequency, and how to adapt these methods for injuries or breaks from traditional training. Throughout, I reference the scientific studies supporting these concepts. This episode should allow anyone to learn or teach more effectively through the use of mental visualization and training.

3ZGItIAUQmI,Neuralink & Technologies to Enhance Human Brains | Dr. Matthew MacDougall,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZGItIAUQmI,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2023-04-17T12:00:04Z,240423,5610,"In this episode my guest is Matthew MacDougall, MD, the head neurosurgeon at Neuralink. Dr. MacDougall trained at the University of California, San Diego and Stanford University School of Medicine and is a world expert in brain stimulation, repair and augmentation. He explains Neuralink’s mission and projects to develop and use neural implant technologies and robotics to restore normal movement to paralyzed patients and to those with neurodegeneration-based movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease) and to repair malfunctions of deep brain circuitry (e.g., those involved in addiction). He also discusses Neuralink’s efforts to create novel brain-machine interfaces (BMI) that enhance human learning, cognition and communication as a means to accelerate human progress. Dr. MacDougall also explains other uses of bio-integrated machines in daily life; for instance, he implanted himself with a radio chip in his hand that allows him to open specific doors, collect and store data and communicate with machines and other objects in unique ways. Listeners will learn about brain health and function through the lens of neurosurgery, neurotechnology, clinical medicine and Neuralink’s bold and unique mission. Anyone interested in how the brain works and can be made to work better ought to derive value from this discussion.

6ZrlsVx85ek,"The Science of Healthy Hair, Hair Loss and How to Regrow Hair | Huberman Lab Podcast",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZrlsVx85ek,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2023-04-10T12:00:06Z,3073569,65127,"In this episode, I explain the biology of hair, hair growth, why hair growth slows and what causes hair to stop growing and/or “fall out.” I discuss the essential role of hair stem cells and other supporting biological factors for healthy hair growth. Then I describe various approaches (mechanical and chemical) to slow hair loss by increasing blood flow to hair stem cells, including minoxidil, tadalafil, PRP, microneedling, Botox and ketoconazole treatments. I also discuss how age-related hormone changes cause hair loss and explain the effectiveness of treatments such as caffeine, saw palmetto, growth hormone, finasteride and dutasteride. For all hair growth options, I describe potential side effects, how soon to expect results and the amount of hair regrowth to expect and I highlight effective combination treatments for hair regrowth even in hair “dead” (bald) zones. For many listeners, thinning, brittle hair, or pattern baldness are a source of anxiety and stress. This episode explains the mechanisms underlying hair regrowth tools and the science behind them so that you can evaluate potential treatments and associated side-effect profiles and select the best one(s) for you.

She explains stress intervention tools using “top-down” techniques (e.g., radical acceptance, mindfulness, reframing) and body-based methods (e.g., breathwork, including the Wim Hof Method), as well as exercise, meditation, body scans and environmental shifts proven to help people cease unhealthy rumination patterns. We discuss how stress can positively impact psychology and sense of purpose, how stress affects cellular aging, how our narratives of stressful events impact our mood and biology and how to effectively reframe stress. She explains science-based techniques to break stress-induced cycles of craving and overeating and thereby improve insulin sensitivity and metabolic health. Dr. Epel provides a wide range of tools shown to be effective in reducing stress and improving various aspects of our health.

K-TW2Chpz4k,Leverage Dopamine to Overcome Procrastination & Optimize Effort | Huberman Lab Podcast,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-TW2Chpz4k,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2023-03-27T12:00:13Z,1994195,42488,"In this episode, I explain how dopamine dynamics — meaning changes and interactions between our baseline and peak levels of dopamine drive our cravings and sense of motivation. I also explain how to leverage dopamine dynamics to overcome procrastination. I cover behavioral, cognitive, nutrition-based and supplementation-based tools to optimize baseline and peak dopamine levels to ensure a persistently motivated state. I also discuss how to boost motivation when you are in a rut, why you might not want to stack behaviors/substances that spike dopamine and how to build and maintain a “growth mindset” for pursuing goals of any kind. Dopamine is an incredibly powerful neuromodulator involved in basic functions (e.g., hunger, romantic attraction, etc.) and feats of cognitive and physical performance; by understanding the dynamics of dopamine, listeners ought to be better positioned to overcome procrastination, maintain motivation, and improve confidence.

We discuss his lab’s discovery that time-restricted eating (TRE), also known as intermittent fasting, has beneficial effects on metabolic health and longevity. Dr. Panda explains how TRE, and longer fasts as well, can positively impact obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular health, age-related chronic diseases and improve mood and cognitive performance. He also describes how the timing of eating, light exposure and exercise that roughly 50% of people engage in negatively affects their health, and he explains how simple adjustments to these factors can improve their subjective sense of wellbeing and biomarkers of cardiovascular function, glucose regulation and metabolism. We discuss how our circadian behaviors, which include patterns of eating, sleeping and socializing, have an enormous impact on our biology, mood and health, and how confining calorie consumption to a semi-regular daily window can enhance physical health, mental health and longevity.

I explain the structure of water and how it is used by the cells and tissues of our body, how much water we each need to drink and when in order to optimize our mental focus and physical performance; and I include how exercise, humidity, heat, and caffeine affect our hydration needs. I explain how temperature and pH influence water’s physical properties and if there is any scientific basis for drinking so-called “pH water” or “alkalized water” to improve health. I explain how to test your tap water for contaminants (e.g., endocrine disruptors) and the documented problems with fluoride in drinking water. I provide options for filtering drinking water and describe different water types (e.g., reverse osmosis, hydrogen-enriched, electrolyzed reduced, deuterium depleted, etc.). Since the human body is mostly water (55-80% depending on one’s age) and water has essential roles in health, disease and cellular function, everyone ought to benefit from understanding how best to clean our tap water, hydrate effectively and in some cases, adjust the type of water we drink to allow our brain and body to function optimally in regard to health and performance.

We discuss his research challenging long-held tenets of genetic inheritance and the relevance of those findings to understanding key biological and psychological processes including metabolism, stress and trauma. He describes the history of the scientific exploration of the “heritability of acquired traits” and how epigenetics and RNA biology can account for the passage of certain experience-based memories. He discusses the importance of model organisms in scientific research and describes his work on how stressors and memories can be passed through small RNA molecules to multiple generations of offspring in ways that meaningfully affect their behavior. Nature vs. nurture is a commonly debated theme; Dr. Rechavi’s work represents a fundamental shift in our understanding of that debate as well as genetic inheritance, brain function and evolution.

I discuss the positive benefits of breathing properly for mood, to reduce psychological and physiological stress, to halt sleep apnea, and improve facial aesthetics and immune system function. I also compare what is known about the effects and effectiveness of different breathing techniques, including physiological sighs, box breathing and cyclic hyperventilation, “Wim Hof Method,” Prānāyāma yogic breathing and more. I also describe how to breath to optimize learning, memory and reaction time and I explain breathing at high altitudes, why “overbreathing” is bad, and how to breathe specifically to relieve cramps and hiccups. Breathwork practices are zero-cost and require minimal time yet provide a unique and powerful avenue to improve overall quality of life that is grounded in clear physiology. Anyone interesting in improving their mental and physical health or performance in any endeavor ought to benefit from the information and tools in this episode.

He explains the cellular mechanisms of muscle soreness and pain, why adequate recovery is essential for all physical adaptations, and how to enhance recovery using breathwork, thermal, movement, and pressure-based techniques. He describes how overtraining impedes exercise progress and how to assess if you are overreaching or overtraining, by using specific biomarkers and indicators. Like other performance metrics, recovery is a skill that can and should be trained, and that can be learned. This episode provides an actionable toolkit for how to monitor and improve your exercise recovery abilities, which will improve your overall mental and physical health.

I describe how to distinguish between the different headache types and how to select the right treatment, including prescription-based and non-prescription-based treatments, behavioral and nutrition-based approaches. I also explain the evidence and mechanisms supporting the use of omega-3 fatty acids, high dose creatine, peppermint oil, turmeric, acupuncture and more. Additionally, I touch on traumatic brain injury, the causes of photophobia, aura, and the link between spicy foods and thunderclap headaches. By the end of this episode, listeners and viewers will have a comprehensive understanding of headaches, their types and the best way to prevent and stop them.

oNkDA2F7CjM,Dr. Andy Galpin: How to Build Physical Endurance & Lose Fat | Huberman Lab Guest Series,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNkDA2F7CjM,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2023-02-01T13:00:27Z,5432356,44571,"This is episode 3 of a 6-part special series on fitness, exercise and performance with Andy Galpin, PhD, professor of kinesiology at California State University, Fullerton. He explains protocols to improve the various kinds of physical endurance: muscular endurance, anerobic capacity, maximum aerobic output, and long duration endurance. He also explains how the body uses different energy sources (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) during rest and exercise. He also explains the mechanisms underlying fat loss and how and why exercise accelerates rates of fat loss. We cover the many concepts related to endurance training and fat loss such as metabolic flexibility, breathwork training for exercise performance and recovery, lactate production and regulation, how to improve blood flow to muscles, anaerobic vs. aerobic metabolism, exercise fatigue, low-carbohydrate diets and fat loss, and how to combine different types of workouts to improve overall endurance. This episode in intended for everyone ranging from novice and recreational exercisers to elite endurance athletes. Anyone wishing to improve their physical health and performance stands to benefit from the information.

O1YRwWmue4Y,How to Optimize Fertility in Males & Females,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1YRwWmue4Y,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2023-01-23T12:00:10Z,360478,7223,"In this episode, I discuss the mechanisms by which human eggs and sperm are generated, the ovulatory/menstrual cycle, the conception process and overall fertility in males and females. I also explain how, regardless of whether you seek to conceive children, optimizing egg and sperm health is directly related to vitality and longevity. I cover the nutrition-based, behavioral, supplement-based and prescription approaches to optimizing egg and sperm health, the ovulatory/menstrual cycle and fertility. In addition, I explain lifestyle choices that greatly assist or harm fertility—several of which are very surprising. I provide science-based protocols for those trying to conceive children. The tools and principles I discuss can also improve overall vitality and longevity in all people, regardless of age. 

Note: At the timestamp related to cumulative probability of pregnancy (2:01:30), I misspoke, my apologies. The data in the following graph are correct but the “120%” is not. 

The appropriate equation is 1-(1-p)^n where p is the probability of getting pregnant in a given cycle and n is the cycle number. Therefore the equation for this scenario is 1-(0.8^6). 

Using the equation, cumulative probability over 6 cycles is 73.8% (rounded to 3 significant figures).

He is also the author of a new book, ""The Creative Act: A Way of Being,"" which explores the creative process and how to access creativity. We discuss topics such as finding inspiration, the role of feelings as guideposts, learning from observing nature, balancing self-doubt and anxiety and adopting new perspectives to channel the creative process. Rick also shares his thoughts on using deadlines, eliminating distractions and how our experiences and emotions influence the creative process. Additionally, we discuss his love for professional wrestling. Our conversation can be applied to any activity or profession to access creativity.

The Huberman Lab Premium subscription was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.

tLS6t3FVOTI,Developing a Rational Approach to Supplementation for Health & Performance | Huberman Lab Podcast,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLS6t3FVOTI,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2023-01-09T13:00:35Z,1640305,25685,"In this episode, I explain how to design a supplementation protocol to support maximum mental and physical health and performance depending on your specific needs, nutrition, lifestyle and finances. When most people hear about “supplements,” they think they are vitamin supplements, but there are many compounds that are powerful and sold over-the-counter that can enhance our health in performance and that can’t be obtained from foods. First, I discuss “foundational” supplements to support overall health, including water and fat-soluble vitamins, minerals, digestive enzymes, adaptogens, and prebiotics/probiotics. Then I explain how to use single-ingredient supplements to enhance specific aspects of your physiology, such as aiding sleep, cognitive enhancement, and focus supporting healthy hormone levels (e.g., testosterone, estrogen and growth hormone, thyroid). Finally, I explain when it makes sense to add supplements to your lifestyle and discuss how best to use supplements, including how to determine dosage, sourcing, continuous schedules and cycling, and how to layer different supplements most effectively. This episode will explain how to design the safest, most biologically effective, cost-effective supplementation protocol to meet your particular goals and support your overall health, including vitality and longevity.

He is the author of multiple best-selling books and is a world-renowned public-facing intellectual on meditation, consciousness, free will, psychedelics and neuroscience. He is also the creator of Waking Up and the host of the Making Sense podcast. In this episode, we discuss meditation as a route to understanding “the self” and experiencing consciousness, not just changing one’s conscious state. Sam describes several meditation techniques and their benefits, including how meditation fundamentally changes our worldview and how it can be merged seamlessly into daily life. It can help us overcome universal challenges such as distractibility and persistent internal dialogue (“chatter”) to allow for deep contentment and pervasive shifts in our awareness, all while acknowledging the more immediate stress-lowering and memory-improving effects of meditation. We also discuss the therapeutic use of psychedelics and the mechanistic similarities between the benefits of a psychedelic journey and long-term meditation practices. And we discuss the rationale behind Sam’s recent decision to close his social media (Twitter) account. This episode should interest anyone wanting to learn more about the higher-order functions of the brain, the brain-body connection, consciousness and, of course, meditation and why and how to meditate for maximum benefit.

We discuss how people can build and sculpt their identity and psychology through specific mindsets and actions and how to adapt the self to novel and challenging situations using specific daily routines. We consider how “energy” actually stems from physical action and describe practical tools and scientific mechanisms for leveraging exercise, cold exposure, nutrition, fasting, hydration, sunlight, mindset and music to make us feel more energized and what that, in turn, does for our life. Jocko explains how discipline and specific daily routines allow for productivity and creativity, and we discuss the qualities of successful leaders, including how to build confidence and real bonds when working with a team or family and friends. Jocko describes a particularly powerful tool of using perspective shifts to allow for detachment as a unique way to identify novel solutions to problems. We also discuss the power of early developmental narratives and how experiences of friendship, love, connection and loss can serve as pillars for making us better human beings in all aspects of life. Our conversation covers a wide range of topics, including mental health, physical health and performance, and provides actionable tools that anyone, regardless of age or profession, can apply to live a more effective and meaningful life.

I discuss how convergent and divergent thinking are essential for generating creative ideas and provide three types of meditation tools (open monitoring meditation, focused attention meditation & non-sleep deep rest; NSDR), which improve our ability to engage in these creative thinking patterns in specific and powerful ways. I also discuss how dopamine and mood contribute to the creative process and describe behavioral, nutritional and supplementation-based approaches for increasing dopamine to engage in creative thought and implementation. I explain how movement and storytelling (narrative) approaches can generate novel creative ideas and how substances like alcohol, cannabis, and psilocybin impact our creative ability. Excitingly, creativity is a skill that can be cultivated and enhanced; this episode outlines many tools to help anyone access creativity and apply creative patterns of thought to different domains of life.

O640yAgq5f8,Tools for Hormone Optimization in Males | Dr. Kyle Gillett,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O640yAgq5f8,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2022-12-12T13:00:10Z,1130761,23665,"My guest is Kyle Gillett, MD, a dual board-certified physician in family medicine and obesity medicine and an expert in optimizing hormone levels to improve overall health. We discuss how to optimize male hormones using a range of nutritional and behavioral tools, exercise and supplementation (including tongkat ali, fadogia agrestis, creatine, peptides and more). We explain how puberty and aging affect hormone levels, how to use bloodwork to monitor hormone levels, how hormone health impacts fertility, libido, hair loss and prostate health and describe behaviors that negatively impact testosterone levels. We also discuss how to approach prescription hormone therapies, including which biomarkers to monitor when using these approaches and how to optimize synergistic hormones (e.g., growth hormone and thyroid hormone) to support complete hormone health safely and rationally. Dr. Gillett offers numerous actionable tools that can be tailored to specific goals and age ranges to attain and maintain optimal levels of male hormones for overall health, well-being and longevity.

The Huberman Lab Premium subscription was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.

iw97uvIge7c,Using Caffeine to Optimize Mental & Physical Performance | Huberman Lab Podcast 101,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2022-12-05T13:00:31Z,1021204,19066,"In this episode, I explain how to use caffeine to enhance mental and physical health and performance, including the optimal dosages and intake schedules for caffeine. I explain how caffeine powerfully reinforces the consumption of certain foods and drinks—thereby increasing how much we like their tastes and seek them out. I discuss the mechanisms by which caffeine increases focus, alertness and mood and reduces sleepiness. I also explain many practical tools for caffeine use, including delaying caffeine intake after waking, intermittent caffeine use, during fasting, before and during exercise, and the use of theanine to curb jitters caused by caffeine. I also discuss the positive effects of caffeine on overall health and longevity and address several myths about caffeine. Since caffeine is one of the most commonly used substances (more than 90% of adults use caffeine daily!), this episode provides actionable tips for adjusting caffeine consumption to positively impact performance and health, including sleep.

We discuss Lex’s recent trip to the heart of the Ukrainian-Russian War, geopolitics, perspectives on people living in war zones, the shared human experience and how information is communicated and controlled. As an experienced podcaster and public educator, Dr. Fridman offers unique insights into the art of holding conversations that grow understanding, especially when they involve people with opposing viewpoints. We also discuss the peer-review process for scientific research publications and how social media and podcasts are evolving the way science and technology are communicated. We consider how to find and follow your life’s purpose, maintain ongoing motivation and implement support systems to build and sustain momentum. Our conversation also covers capitalism, masculinity, chess and cheating, Lex’s idea for an AI robotics start-up and a Q&A from audience questions solicited on social media. Dr. Fridman is one of the main inspirations for the Huberman Lab Podcast, so hosting him for this special centennial episode was an honor and a pleasure!

He explains the important connection between nutrition, metabolism and mental health and his pioneering work using the ketogenic diet to successfully treat patients with various mental illnesses, including depression and schizophrenia. Dr. Palmer explains how the ketogenic diet is an evidence-based treatment for epilepsy, mimics the fasted state and can offset cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease. He describes the key roles of mitochondria in mental health, how certain conditions likely arise from mitochondrial dysfunction and how low-carbohydrate diets increase mitochondrial turnover to improve mental health. He also explains how low-carbohydrate diets positively impact the gut microbiome and weight loss, highlights important risk factors for mitochondrial health such as marijuana and alcohol, and discusses the best way to increase circulating ketones depending on individual needs. We also cover how a ketogenic diet impacts mood, sleep and fertility. Dr. Palmer’s work stands as a revolutionary approach to mental health and disease that, given the prevalence of mental health challenges, should be of interest to people of all backgrounds and ages.

While it is difficult to standardize happiness from one person to the next, I outline a structured framework of what is critical to increasing your innate “natural happiness,” including financial security, purposeful work and relationships, and I explain specific tools to increase internal happiness (so-called “synthetic happiness”). I review how specific types of human connection and attention to our choices (or lack thereof) can increase or undermine our level of happiness. I also discuss the importance of certain types of physical contact, gratitude, financial choices and volunteer contributions that research shows can maximize happiness. And I discuss how factors such as children, pets, physical well-being, substance use, prior traumas and life-phase milestones affect our quest for and depth of happiness.

The Huberman Lab Premium subscription was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.

wTBSGgbIvsY,How Meditation Works & Science-Based Effective Meditations | Huberman Lab Podcast #96,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTBSGgbIvsY,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2022-10-31T12:00:48Z,6854189,100343,"In this episode, I discuss the biological mechanisms of the state changes that occur during different types of meditation and describe how to develop the meditation practice optimal for you. I explain key meditation principles, such as using specific breathwork patterns and adjusting your perception to specific locations along the continuum between interoception, exteroception and dissociation. I discuss how meditation practices lead to long-term trait changes and neuroplasticity, including changing your default mood, reducing baseline anxiety/depression, increasing your ability to focus, enhancing relaxation, improving sleep, and increasing your overall happiness level. I also explain the concept behind the “third-eye center,” what mindfulness is from a biological standpoint, the power of ultra-brief meditations and how to select the best meditation and time and duration to meditate to meet your need. I also explain a novel open-eyed perception-based meditation that may enhance focus, relaxation and task-switching ability. Whether you are a novice or an experienced meditator or simply interested in how our brain controls different aspects of conscious awareness and self-regulation, this episode should interest you.

q1Ss8sTbFBY,Fitness Toolkit: Protocol & Tools to Optimize Physical Health | Huberman Lab Podcast #94,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Ss8sTbFBY,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2022-10-17T12:00:37Z,1590666,28220,"I describe a fitness protocol that maximizes all the major sought-after aspects of physical fitness, including strength, endurance and flexibility. I discuss fundamentals of resistance training protocols, including repetitions, sets, inter-set and inter-workout rest periods and periodization of intensity and volume to improve strength and hypertrophy. I also explain how to integrate this with endurance training across the week by controlling the duration, timing and intensity of cardiovascular workouts. I also cover science-based protocols on leveraging the mind-body connection, deliberate breathing (during and after exercise), stretching, deliberate heat and cold exposure, and non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) for better workout performance and faster recovery. Further, I tackle a range of real-world issues that can affect a consistent training schedule, such as whether you should train if you are sick, have had a poor night of sleep or had a stressful event and how to start training again after a break and whether you should train in a fasted or fed state. Physical fitness is a key variable for immediate and long-term health. This episode provides a modifiable “foundational” template that can be adjusted based on your current fitness level, goals, time constraints, and access to different types of equipment.

He is also the director of the Stanford Brain Stimulation Lab. We discuss clinical applications of brain stimulation, behavioral protocols and novel drug treatments to halt and reverse mental health disorders, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We first explore the neural circuits for self-identity and mood and stress control. We then cover Dr. Williams’ work using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to treat depression, trauma, PTSD and other mood disorders. Next, we dive into the history, biology, modern use and safety margins of various psychedelics, including MDMA, LSD, ketamine, ibogaine, ayahuasca and psilocybin, as well as cannabis and the use of SSRIs in both adults and children. Finally, we discuss behavioral treatments for mental health disorders, including sleep and sleep deprivation, light exposure, exercise and training to control the brain–heart rate pathways. Regardless of age, anyone interested in mental health should benefit from the incredible breadth and depth of Dr. Williams’ knowledge and the clarity with which he conveys that information.

gXvuJu1kt48,The Effects of Cannabis (Marijuana) on the Brain & Body | Huberman Lab Podcast #92,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXvuJu1kt48,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2022-10-03T12:00:25Z,3318817,73057,"In this episode, I discuss cannabis (aka marijuana), including the biological mechanisms underlying its effects on the mind and body, its known medical applications, its impact on libido, creativity, hunger, hormones and more. I also cover the known adverse health consequences of chronic and even acute (one-time) use and the factors that determine if cannabis is helpful or harmful. Additionally, I detail how the various strains of cannabis: sativa, indica and hybrid strains, can produce such divergent effects depending on the strain type, THC-to-CBD ratio, total dosage, and frequency of use. I review why cannabis can impact speech patterns and one’s propensity to develop anxiety/depression during and after use and, in some individuals, paranoia. As the legal landscape for cannabis is rapidly evolving, this episode should interest a wide audience, including former/current cannabis users, those in the medical, sports, law enforcement, and educational communities and, of course, children, teenagers, and parents.

Dr. Halpern’s research and clinical practice focus on using deep brain stimulation to treat compulsive and movement disorders—for example, binge eating disorder, bulimia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor and dystonia. We discuss using deep brain stimulation to help patients who suffer from movement and compulsive disorders and its application to patients afflicted with binge eating. We also explore the use of this technology for other conditions such as OCD, anorexia and tremor, and examine future therapeutic directions involving non-invasive brain stimulation approaches, including transcranial magnetic stimulation and ultrasound, for the treatment of other psychiatric illnesses and conditions. This episode will interest those curious about the biology of eating, anorexia, bulimia, compulsive thoughts and behaviors and movement.

uXs-zPc63kM,Nicotine’s Effects on the Brain & Body & How to Quit Smoking or Vaping | Huberman Lab Podcast #90,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXs-zPc63kM,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2022-09-19T12:00:39Z,1738409,35385,"In this episode, I explain how nicotine impacts the brain and body, including its potent ability to enhance attention, focus, and alertness, increase blood pressure and metabolism and reduce appetite. I discuss nicotine’s ability to increase the action of neurochemicals, including dopamine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine and activate sympathetic (alertness-promoting) neural circuits. I also discuss common nicotine delivery methods, such as cigarettes, vaping, dip, and snuff, and how they each create their own unique experience and how they, but not nicotine itself, cause cancer and other adverse health effects. I also explain science-based tools to permanently quit smoking cigarettes or vaping, including peer-reviewed clinical hypnosis tools, antidepressants, and alternative nicotine replacement (patches, lozenges, gums etc.). As nicotine is one of the most widely used substances with billions of users — most of whom report wanting to quit — this episode ought to be of interest to former/current nicotine users, those who want to quit smoking or vaping and/or those interested in learning the biology behind how nicotine impacts the brain and body.

Dr. Anderson is a Professor of Biology at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), a member of the National Academy of Sciences and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). We discuss how states of mind and body arise and persist and how they probably better explain human behavior than emotions per se. We also discuss the many kinds of arousal that create varying levels of pressure for certain behaviors to emerge. We discuss different types of violent aggression and how they are impacted by biological sex, gender, context, prior experience and hormones and the neural interconnectedness of fear, aggression and sexual behavior. We also discuss peptides and their role in social isolation–induced anxiety and aggression. Dr. Anderson also describes novel, potentially powerful therapeutics for mental health. This episode should interest anyone wanting to learn more about mental health, human emotions and sexual and/or violent behavior.

yb5zpo5WDG4,Focus Toolkit: Tools to Improve Your Focus & Concentration | Huberman Lab Podcast #88,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb5zpo5WDG4,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2022-09-05T12:00:39Z,1669796,38694,"In this episode, I provide a list of behavioral, nutritional, and supplement-based tools you can use to improve your ability to get into a focused state to do mental or physical work. I explain science-supported strategies for transitioning into focus, maintaining focus during the work bout, and exiting the focus session, which is also critical, including decompression/defocusing tools. I explain when and how to use: binaural beats, caffeine, deliberate cold exposure, the pros and cons of working in fasted vs. fed states, and supplements and foods that enhance dopamine, epinephrine (i.e., adrenaline) and acetylcholine to promote optimal focus. Also, I explain how short behavioral practices, such as meditation and visual gaze training, will benefit your ability to focus over the long term. As deep focus is crucial to significantly improve cognitive or physical performance in any realm, this episode should be useful to anyone. By the end, you’ll have an essential toolkit of science-supported, low- to zero-cost focus and concentration strategies to select from that can be tailored to your physical and mental performance needs.

Dr. Jarvis' research spans the molecular and genetic mechanisms of vocal communication, comparative genomics of speech and language across species and the relationship between speech, language and movement. We discuss the unique ability of humans (and certain animal species) to learn and communicate using complex language, including verbal speech production and the ability to interpret both written and spoken language. We also discuss the connections between language, singing and dance, and why song may have evolved before language. Dr. Jarvis also explains some of the underlying biological and genetic components of stuttering/speech disorders, non-verbal communication, why it's easiest to learn a language as a child and how individuals can learn multiple languages at any age. This episode ought to be of interest to everyone interested in the origins of human speech, language, music and culture and how newer technology, such as social media and texting, changes our brains.

DkS1pkKpILY,"What Alcohol Does to Your Body, Brain & Health",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2022-08-22T12:00:08Z,7634635,142900,"In this episode, I discuss the physiological effects that drinking alcohol has on the brain and body at different levels of consumption and over time. I also describe genetic differences that predispose certain individuals to alcoholism, binge and habit-drinking. I explain alcohol metabolism in simple terms and how it effectively acts as a poison, leading to cellular stress and damage. I then explain that it impacts neuronal function and changes our thinking and behavior – hallmarks of inebriation. I also discuss how alcohol consumption of different amounts impacts inflammation, stress, neurodegeneration, and cancer risk and negatively impacts the gut microbiome, brain thickness, hormone balance, mood and feelings of motivation. Additionally, I discuss the biology of hangovers and describe science-based strategies to mitigate the severity of a hangover. Since alcohol is one of the most widely consumed recreational substances, this episode ought to be of relevance to everyone.  Indeed, even low-to-moderate alcohol consumption negatively impacts the brain and body in direct ways. The goal of this episode is to help people make informed decisions about their alcohol consumption that are in keeping with their mental and physical health goals.

h2aWYjSA1Jc,Sleep Toolkit: Tools for Optimizing Sleep & Sleep-Wake Timing | Huberman Lab Podcast #84,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2aWYjSA1Jc,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2022-08-08T12:00:25Z,2223579,50343,"In this episode, I describe a comprehensive toolkit consisting of behavioral and supplement-based tools that you can customize to enhance the quality, duration and impact of your sleep. This has an enormous positive impact on your overall health and daytime functioning, brain, hormones and immune system. I teach you how to effectively harness light (and darkness), temperature, food, exercise, caffeine, supplements, and digital devices in order to fall asleep faster, stay deeply asleep longer and overall, and achieve better quality sleep. I also describe how these tools can be modified to recover quickly from a poor night’s sleep, jet lag or bouts of shift work. Given that sleep is the foundation of all mental health, physical health and performance, this episode should benefit everyone as it provides an essential toolkit of science-supported, low- to zero-cost strategies that can be tailored to optimize your sleep routine.

m_OazsImOiI,The Science & Treatment of Bipolar Disorder | Huberman Lab Podcast #82,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_OazsImOiI,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2022-07-25T12:00:37Z,1190299,24971,"In this episode, I explain the biology, symptoms, causes and types of bipolar disorder (sometimes called bipolar depression). I discuss neuroplasticity and how the brain normally regulates mood, energy, and perceptions; then, I contrast that with the biology of bipolar disorder, which is characterized by extremes of energy and mood, e.g., mania and depression. I outline the mechanisms through which bipolar disorder manifests in the brain, including deficits of interoception and reduced connections between the parietal and limbic systems. I also outline how treatment options (such as lithium) work in part through homeostatic plasticity.’ I discuss not only lithium but also the treatment of bipolar with ketamine, different talk therapies, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and nutraceuticals, including Omega-3 and Inositol supplementation. This episode should interest anyone who has or knows someone with bipolar disorder and, more broadly, those interested in how the brain works to create a balance between thoughts, energy levels, focus, and mood.

UChhXiFPRgg,The Biology of Taste Perception & Sugar Craving | Dr. Charles Zuker,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChhXiFPRgg,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2022-07-18T12:00:19Z,206928,4436,"My guest this episode is Dr. Charles Zuker, PhD, Professor of Biochemistry, Molecular Biophysics and Neuroscience at Columbia University and an Investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Dr. Zuker is the world’s leading expert in the biology of taste, thirst and craving. His laboratory explores the mechanisms of taste perception, focusing on how our conscious and unconscious processing of specific foods and nutrients guide our actions and behaviors. We discuss the neural circuits of taste, the “gut-brain axis,” the basis of food cravings and the key difference between wanting (craving) and liking (perceiving) sugar. We also explore how taste perception relates to specific food satiety, thirst, emotions and expectation. We consider how sugar-containing and highly processed foods can hijack the natural balance of the taste and digestive systems. Dr. Zuker provides a true masterclass in the biology of taste and perception that ought to be of interest to anyone curious about how the brain works, our motivated behaviors and the neural, chemical perceptual aspects of the mind.

Then, with that foundational understanding in mind, I describe a potent toolkit of science-supported behavioral, nutrition, and supplementation tools that can be used to increase baseline levels of individual neuromodulators and that can be modified for specific goals. This episode summarizes low-or-no-cost, actionable, science-based tools that can benefit anyone in order to enhance their levels of brain chemicals and improve mental health, physical health, and performance.

I also discuss the efficacy and mechanisms behind OCD treatments—both behavioral and pharmacologic as well as holistic and combination treatments and new emerging treatments, including directed brain stimulation. I explain the neural circuitry underlying repetitive “thought-action loops” and why in OCD, the compulsive actions merely make the obsessions even stronger. I review cognitive-behavioral therapies like exposure therapy and SSRIs, holistic approaches, and nutraceuticals, detailing the efficacy of each approach and what science says about how to combine and sequence treatments. I describe an often effective approach for treating OCD where clinicians use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to deliberately bring patients into states of high anxiety while encouraging them to suppress compulsive actions in order to help them learn to overcome repetitious thought/action cycles. This episode should interest anyone with OCD, anyone who knows someone with OCD or OCPD, and more generally, those interested in how the brain works to control thoughts and actions, whether those thoughts are intrusive or not.

Ido has spent a lifetime studying, combining and evolving elements from an enormous range of martial arts, dance genres, athletic endeavors and science to develop a unified theory and practice of movement called “The Ido Portal Method.” Here we discuss all things movement, including the role of the nervous system, reflexive versus deliberate movement patterns and the link between emotions and awareness in movement. We also explore learning and neuroplasticity, the mind-body connection and how movement itself can be leveraged toward expanding other types of skills—cognitive, creative and otherwise. As one of the most sought-after teachers of movement alive today, Ido shares knowledge in this conversation that can benefit everyone—children, adults, athletes, dancers, clinicians, trainers and the everyday person.

tkH2-_jMCSk,Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkH2-_jMCSk,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2022-06-13T12:00:28Z,3987735,53538,"In this episode, I explain the science behind limb range of motion and flexibility and how to increase them by using science-supported protocols. Flexibility is crucial for physical movements and can help prevent injuries, decrease inflammation, modulate physical and mental pain, impact exercise recovery speed and even potentially slow the progression of certain diseases. I explain the biology of flexibility, including the specific neural mechanisms that sense stretch and load (i.e., tension) on the muscles and limbs, as well as how specific brain regions like the insula combine those signals to ultimately control limb range of movement. I also provide science-based stretching and “micro-stretching” protocols that reliably improve limb flexibility with the minimum necessary time investment. I review all the details of those stretching protocols: how often to do them, for how long, their timing relative to other exercises, sets, the time between sets, measuring progress and more. All people, physically active or not, should benefit from the information and tools described in this episode.

Dr. Conti earned his MD at Stanford and completed his residency at Harvard Medical School. He now runs the Pacific Premiere Group—a clinical practice helping people heal and grow from trauma and other life challenges.

We discuss trauma: what it is, its far-reaching effects on the mind and body and the best treatment approaches. We also explore how to choose a therapist and how to get the most out of therapy, as well as how to do self-directed therapy. We examine the positive and negative effects of antidepressants, ADHD medications, alcohol, cannabis and the therapeutic potential of psychedelics (e.g., psilocybin and LSD), ketamine and MDMA.

This episode is a must-listen for anyone seeking or already doing therapy, processing trauma and/or considering psychoactive medication. Both patients and practitioners ought to benefit from the information.

dzOvi0Aa2EA,The Science & Process of Healing From Grief,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzOvi0Aa2EA,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2022-05-30T12:00:17Z,1081288,26925,"This episode, I discuss grief and the challenges of processing losses of different kinds. I explain the biological mechanisms of grief, including how neural circuits for emotional and factual memory combine with those for love and attachment, to create feelings of absence and yearning. I discuss how grief is distinct from depression, yet why they can feel so similar. I also provide science-based tools to assist with the grieving process, including how to reframe and remap the relationship with those we have lost while still maintaining a strong emotional connection to them. I also explain the importance of having and building strong foundational psychological and biological states so that we can better cope with grief when it happens. Finally, I describe tools to adjust those states, including those for accessing sleep, managing stress and emotional swings. This episode is for those suffering from grief but also for everyone, given that we all experience grief at some point in our lives.

We recorded this episode before the recent mass shooting tragedies in the United States. While we hope the information in this episode will be of use to anyone suffering from grief of any kind and at any time, we are also careful to acknowledge that many people require additional support and resources. For that reason, we include mention of such resources and we generally hope people will access them if needed.

I also describe tools that can be used to modulate the factors that have been shown to ‘prime’ an individual for aggression, including sunlight, estrogen sensitivity, competition within social settings, and overall stress levels, and the hormone cortisol. I discuss how substances such as caffeine and alcohol can impact impulsive behaviors and how nutrition and supplementation can be used to regulate mood and aggression.

I detail specific protocols for deliberate heat exposure, including exposure times, temperature ranges to consider, time of day, and delivery mechanisms (sauna vs. hot bath vs. open air heat, etc.) in order to achieve different specific outcomes, including dramatic growth hormone releases, or reduction in cortisol levels. I also discuss the ability of locally applied heat to heal or otherwise improve various bodily tissues and new data on how local application of heat may induce the conversion of metabolically sluggish white fat to metabolically robust beige fat.

I detail specific protocols to safely engage in deliberate cold exposure, including minimal exposure times, time-of-day effects, determining optimal temperatures, recovery, mindset, and movement during cold exposure. I discuss how cold exposure can be used to safely stress the body to improve attention, mood, and cognitive focus and boost metabolism and reduce inflammation. Also, I explain how cold exposure on specific regions of the body (called glabrous skin surfaces) can be leveraged to enhance endurance and weight training and increase work output.

azb3Ih68awQ,Using Salt to Optimize Mental & Physical Performance | Huberman Lab Podcast #63,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azb3Ih68awQ,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2022-03-14T12:00:01Z,2129551,40109,"I discuss the role of salt (sodium) in the nervous system and the key role that it plays in mental performance, physical performance and health. I explain how the brain senses salt levels in our body and how that relates to our feelings of thirst. I cover the physiology of the renal system and the hormones that control sodium and water balance in our body. I also explore how salt interacts with stress and our immune systems and its crucial role in neuron function. Additionally, I examine research findings suggesting that some individuals might benefit from increased intake of sodium and other electrolytes (magnesium and potassium) to enhance mental performance, lessen anxiety, and offset dizziness. Yet, other people may need less sodium. I discuss how you can determine your optimal sodium intake and why sodium intake levels need to be uniquely tailored to an individual’s lifestyle. Finally, I explain how salt creates ‘hidden’ sugars in many processed foods and the problems that can create. Throughout the episode, I explain peer-reviewed findings outlining salt’s essential role in overall health and describe general recommendations and tools anyone can use to find their optimal salt balance and thereby enhance their brain and body’s performance.

Dr. Sonnenburg’s research focuses on how microbes in our gut impact our mental and physical health and how diet and environment shape the gut microbiome. We discuss the architecture of the gut microbiome and microbiota variability in different regions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and how these can change in response to diet, environment or genetics. We explore the early establishment of the microbiome and how the mode of delivery into the world (cesarean section, C-section, or vaginal birth) shapes the gut. We also discuss lifestyle factors that can alter the microbiome and the integral role the gut microbiome plays in communicating with other organs, including the brain.

Dr. Sonnenburg details his recent clinical study, which found that diets rich in fermented foods, but not fiber, increase microbiota diversity and reduce signals of inflammation. Additionally, we examine how foods typical of Western diets—for example, high-fat, low-fiber processed foods—can negatively impact the gut microbiome. Throughout the episode, we discuss actionable tools from peer-reviewed clinical findings that anyone can implement, regardless of budget, to optimize their gut microbiome and health.

I cover the structure and function of the gut-brain axis and the role of the gut microbiome in the brain and overall health. I describe how the gut controls hunger or satiety by affecting neurons in our brain. I also contrast the many pathways by which the gut influences the brain: direct vs. indirect pathways, chemical vs. mechanical, and fast vs. slow signaling. Additionally, I discuss what defines a healthy microbiome and how your lifestyle impacts the gut microbiome, including the effects of stress, fasting, antibiotics, pets, environment, prebiotics and probiotics. I address how different foods shape the gut microbiome, in particular, the emerging data that fermented foods can increase the diversity of healthy gut microbiota.  Throughout the episode, I explain peer-reviewed and textbook findings that reveal the critical role of the gut microbiome in supporting mental and physical health and I outline simple tools that anyone can use in order to enhance their gut microbiome health.

I explain how childhood attachment types are thought to inform adult attachment styles to romantic partners, and I describe some of the major theories of human mate selection, relationships and infidelity. Additionally, I explore the neurobiology and proposed subconscious processing underlying desire, love and attachment, including the roles of empathy and “positive delusion.” I outline how self-awareness can shift one’s relationship attachment style towards securely bonded partnerships.  Finally, I describe specific tools and supplements that have been researched to increase libido and sex drive. Throughout the episode, I explain the science and key mechanisms underlying romantic love and outline tools for those seeking to find a strong, healthy relationship, or for those wanting to strengthen an existing relationship.

BwyZIWeBpRw,Using Play to Rewire & Improve Your Brain,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwyZIWeBpRw,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2022-02-07T13:00:13Z,468917,11591,"In this episode, I discuss the transformative nature of play—how it changes our feelings, thoughts and actions and indeed, how it can rewire our brain to function better in all contexts. I explain the role of play in childhood, as well as adulthood in skill and social development and describe key characteristics of the mind and body during play. Additionally, I explore how play allows the brain to test contingencies in different roles/environments. Throughout, I discuss the underlying neurobiology of play. I also describe how low-stakes play, and tinkering can broaden and shape your future capabilities. Finally, I discuss how our childhood ‘personal play identity’ informs our adult personality. Throughout the episode, I use the science of play to outline recommendations for using play as a means to enhance neuroplasticity and explore novel situations, regardless of age.

I discuss how to adjust light, physically arrange your work environment, and leverage body posture to enhance productivity. Additionally, I explore how to shift your work environment for particular types of tasks. Moreover, I review the role of body movement in the workspace. I also discuss sound-based tools that can either enhance or diminish cognitive functioning (the ability to focus on deep work). I describe a particular frequency of binaural beats that studies show can be used to enhance memory and recall. This episode covers quality peer-reviewed findings practical tools anyone can use, regardless of budget, in order to optimize their workspace to achieve heightened levels of productivity, increased alertness and focus, and creativity.

Dr. Crum is a world expert on mindsets and beliefs, and how they shape our responses to stress, exercise and even the foods we eat. We discuss how our mindset about the nutritional content of food changes how satisfying it is to us at a physiological (hormonal and metabolic) level. She also explains how mindsets about exercise can dramatically alter the effects of exercise on weight loss, blood pressure and other health metrics. Dr. Crum teaches us how to think about stress in ways that allow stress to grow us and bring out our best rather than diminish our health and performance. Throughout the episode, Dr. Crum shares high-quality peer-reviewed scientific findings that we can all leverage to improve health and performance in our lives.

I explain the neural (brain) circuits that underlie goal setting and pursuit. Then I describe nine science-supported tools anyone can apply toward their goals. I explain when and how to use goal visualization, when to use multitasking and how to use specific rewards to improve the likelihood of reaching your goals. I also explain why envisioning failures and their consequences are effective and how to set goals of the appropriate level of challenge. I also explain how the molecule dopamine is used to gauge our progress toward milestones and long-term overarching goals and how to leverage dopamine for goal pursuit. Finally, I explain a unique tool called 'space-time bridging' that can be used to support all aspects of goal setting, assessment, and pursuit. This episode ought to be useful for anyone seeking to improve their performance in work, school, exercise, athletics, or personal development.

We discuss how and why humans breathe the way we do, the function of the diaphragm and how it serves to increase oxygenation of the brain and body. We also explore how breathing influences mental state, fear, memory, reaction time and more. Additionally, we cover specific breathing protocols such as box breathing, cyclic hyperventilation (similar to Wim Hof breathing), nasal versus mouth breathing, unilateral breathing and how each of these affects the brain and body. We examine physiological sighs, peptides expressed by specific neurons controlling breathing and magnesium compounds that can improve cognitive ability and how they work. This conversation serves as a sort of master class on the science of breathing and breathing-related tools for health and performance.

Wcs2PFz5q6g,The Science of Making & Breaking Habits,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcs2PFz5q6g,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2022-01-03T13:00:12Z,5381453,93352,"In this episode, I review the science of habit formation and habit elimination and how the process of neuroplasticity (brain rewiring) underlies these processes. 

I describe two new systems for habit formation. The first system is grounded in the neuroscience of brain states and our ability to perform (and to avoid) certain tasks at different phases of the 24-hour day. The second system focuses on 21-day habit formation and consolidation.

I also discuss ""task bracketing"" as an approach to enhancing habit formation and eliminating unwanted habits and the neural circuits that underlie task bracketing in the basal ganglia (a brain region for generating and stopping behaviors). I also review the science of dopamine rewards and how to apply that knowledge to shaping habits. 

The science and tools in this episode ought to be helpful for anyone looking to build better habits and eliminate unwanted habits for school, work, fitness, relationships, creative endeavors, and more—indeed for any person or situation where behavioral changes are needed.

Dr. Sinclair is also the author of the book Lifespan: Why We Age & Why We Don't Have To and the host of the Lifespan podcast, which launches January 5, 2022.

In this interview, we discuss the cellular and molecular mechanisms of aging and what we all can do to slow or reverse the process. We cover fasting and supplementation with resveratrol, NAD, metformin and NMN. We also explore the use of caffeine, exercise, cold exposure and why excessive iron load is harmful. Further topics include food choices for offsetting aging and promoting autophagy (clearance of dead cells) and the key blood markers everyone should monitor to determine biological versus chronological age. We look ahead to the future of longevity research and technology.

This episode includes extensive basic science and specific, actionable protocols, right down to the details of what to do and when. By the end, you will have in-depth knowledge of the biology of aging and how to offset it.

I explain the neural and hormonal basis for ""social homeostasis"" (our drive for a given amount of socializing) which reveals why we get lonely, why we seek out connection with others and how power dynamics (hierarchies) shape those connections. I also discuss the neurochemical basis of introversion and extroversion, of trust and how shared experiences that promote similar physiological states in two or more individuals, leads to more rapid bonding. I also discuss how food and oxytocin play key roles in social bonding. This episode covers quality peer-reviewed science and practical tools for anyone seeking to find, build or end relationships.

Dr. Berson discovered the neurons in your eye that set your biological rhythms for sleep, wakefulness, mood and appetite. He is also a world-renowned teacher of basic and advanced neuroscience, having taught thousands of university lectures on this topic. Many of his students have become world-leading neuroscientists and teachers themselves.

Here Dr. Berson takes us on a structured journey into and around the nervous system, explaining how we perceive the world and our internal landscape, how we balance, see and remember, how we learn and perform reflexive and deliberate actions, how we visualize and imagine in our mind and how the various circuits of the brain coordinate all these incredible feats.

We discuss practical and real-life examples of neural circuit function across the lifespan. Dr. Berson gives us a masterclass in the nervous system—one that, in just under two hours, will teach you an entire course's worth about the brain and how yours works.

31wjVhCcI5Y,Erasing Fears & Traumas Based on the Modern Neuroscience of Fear,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31wjVhCcI5Y,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2021-12-06T13:00:03Z,2266858,53198,"In this episode, I discuss fear and trauma, including the neural circuits involved in the ""threat reflex"" and how specific experiences and memories come to activate that system. I also discuss how our body is involved in trauma and fear. First, I describe the logic of fear mechanisms and how ""top-down"" processing-- meaning connections from the parts of the brain that assign meaning to our feelings, are involved in fear and erasing fears and traumas. Then I discuss what successful fear and trauma treatment must include and consider various treatments for whether they meet that standard, such as EMDR, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Ketamine and other drug-assisted therapies and more. I also review new data on how 5 minutes per day of deliberate, self-imposed stress can erase fear and depression. And I review the role that social connection plays in erasing or maintaining fears by activating specific molecular pathways in the brain and body. Finally, I review supplementation with over-the-counter compounds for their effects on anxiety and fear and when to take them, if at all.

HXzTbCEqCJc,How Humans Select & Keep Romantic Partners in Short & Long Term | Dr. David Buss,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXzTbCEqCJc,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2021-11-29T13:00:20Z,958635,25317,"In this episode my guest is Dr. David Buss, Professor of Psychology at the University of Texas at Austin and one of the founding members of the field of evolutionary psychology.

Dr. Buss describes his work on how people select mates for short- and long-term relationships, the dynamics of human courtship and mate value assessment — meaning how people measure up as potential partners.

We also discuss the causes of infidelity and differences in infidelity between men and women. He explains how people evaluate and try to alter other people’s mate value as a means to secure and even poach mates. We discuss monogamous and non-monogamous relationships in humans and what Dr. Buss calls “the dark triad” — features common in stalkers and narcissists that relate to sexual and psychological violence in relationships.

This episode is sure to interest anyone who is single or in a relationship and wants to understand how people select mates, as well as anyone interested in forming and maintaining healthy romantic partnerships.

I explain, however, that most commonly used gratitude practices are ineffective (such as gratitude lists). The key elements of highly effective gratitude practices are described, including the essential need for story (narrative), receiving or perceiving gratitude rather than giving it, and the role that theory of mind plays in this context. I also discuss why we can't simply make up feelings of gratitude and how reluctance undermines the process. I also explain the neural circuit mechanisms that underlie the reductions in fear and increases in motivation and lowering of inflammatory chemicals that effective narrative-based gratitude can trigger. Throughout the episode, I use the science of gratitude to design a brief but highly effective protocol.

I review the three types of time perception: of the past, of the present, and the future, and how dopamine and serotonin adjust both our perception of the speed of the passage of time and our memory of how long previous experiences lasted. I also discuss circannual entrainment, which is the process by which our brain and body are matched to the seasons, and circadian (24 hours) entrainment, both of which subconsciously adjust our perceived measurement of time. I explain the mechanisms of that subconscious control. And I cover the ultradian (90 minutes) rhythms that govern our ability to focus, including how to track when these 90-minute rhythms begin and end for the sake of work and productivity. I include ten tools based on the science of time perception that you can apply to enhance productivity, creativity, and relationships in various contexts.

We discuss specific resistance (weight) training regimens for increasing testosterone in men and women and how to vary mechanical loads and rest between sets and workouts to optimize hormone output and training results. We also discuss how stress-induced catecholamines can increase or decrease testosterone depending on duration and mindset. We discuss specific cold and heat therapies for increasing resilience, reducing inflammation, promoting heat shock proteins and more. We discuss nutrition for training and how to match nutrition to training goals and metabolic flexibility. We discuss mental focus and how long to train for skill development. Finally, we discuss how mixed martial arts and the UFC Performance Institute are a template for exploring human performance more generally. This episode is intended for anyone interested in athletic and mental performance: athletes, students and recreational exercisers, and includes both science and many practical tools people can apply in their own training.

I discuss how our immune system works and science-supported tools we can use to enhance our immune system.

I discuss the innate and adaptive immune systems and our various microbiomes-- not just in our gut but also in our nose, eyes and mouth and how to keep them healthy. And I review how specific patterns of breathing and foods maintain a healthy mucosal barrier that is crucial for fighting infections. I discuss how certain neurochemicals called catecholamines enhance our immune system function and how to use specific breathing protocols, types and timing of heat and cold exposure, and, if appropriate, supplementation to activate catecholamines. I also discuss the role and use of serotonin for the sake of accessing the specific types of sleep for recovering from illness, and I discuss how to increase glymphatic ""washout"" of brain debris during sleep. I also review fever, the vagus nerve and the use of atypical yet highly effective compounds for rhinitis (nasal inflammation).

Dr. Hattar is a world-renowned expert on how viewing light at particular times adjusts our mood, ability to learn, stress and hormone levels, appetite and mental health. We discuss how to determine and use your individual light sensitivity to determine the optimal sleep–wake cycle for you. We also discuss how to combine your light viewing and waking time with the timing of your food intake and exercise in order to maximize mental and physical functioning. Dr. Hattar is credited with co-discovering the neurons in the eye that set our circadian clocks and regulate mood and appetite. He explains why even a small shift in daylight saving time leads to outsized effects on our biology because our cells and circadian clocks integrate across many days. He offers precise tools to rapidly adjust to jet lag, shift work and reset your clock after a late night of work or socializing. This episode is filled with cutting-edge data on the biological mechanisms of human physiology and practical tools for people of all ages.

E7W4OQfJWdw,Nutrients For Brain Health & Performance | Huberman Lab Podcast #42,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7W4OQfJWdw,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2021-10-18T12:00:13Z,1475361,32504,"This episode I describe science-supported nutrients for brain and performance (cognition) and for nervous system health generally.

I describe 10 tools for this purpose, including specific amounts and sources for Omega-3 fatty acids which make up the ""structural fat"" of neurons (nerve cells) and allow them to function across our lifespan. I also review data on creatine, phosphatidylserine, anthocyanins, choline, glutamine and how they each impact brain function in healthy people seeking to reinforce and improve their cognition and in those combatting cognitive decline. I describe both food-based and supplement-based sources for these compounds, and their effective dose ranges based on peer-reviewed literature.

Then I review the 3 factors: gut-brain signaling, perceived taste, and learned associations that combine with the metabolic and blood-sugar-elevating effects of food to determine what foods we seek and prefer. Amazingly, it's not just about what tastes good to us. Next, I explore how we can leverage the neural circuits of learned food preference toward seeking and enjoying the right foods for brain health and performance. I also review new data on non-caloric sweeteners and why consuming them with glucose-elevating foods can be detrimental,  in some cases rapidly leading to insulin dysregulation. This episode covers more than 10 actionable tools for those seeking to improve and/or maintain brain function, and it explains modern neuroscience underlying of our sense of taste, our food seeking preferences and brain metabolism.

I review the data on how limiting food intake to specific portions of every 24-hour cycle (or fasting longer) impacts weight loss, fat loss specifically, liver health, mental focus, muscle, longevity and more. I explain how ""fasted"" is contextual, and relates to blood glucose levels and their downstream effects, and how the depth of fasting can be adjusted with behaviors such as different types of exercise, or with glucose disposal agents. I also discuss the optimal fasting protocol: and both the absolute (non-negotiable) and variable (contextual) features of a fasting/time-restricted-feeding protocol that will allow you to get the most benefits. I also discuss what does and does not break a fast, the effects of fasting on hormones like testosterone and cortisol and on fertility. I also review how different feeding windows of 8 or 10 or 4 hours differentially impact the effects of fasting, and why the classic 8 hour feeding window came to be but also might be ideal. I discuss mechanisms and offer tools to discern the optimal fasting duration and timing for you.

We discuss how the body and brain maintain temperature under different conditions and how almost everyone uses the wrong approach to cool off or heat up. Dr. Heller teaches us the best ways and, in doing so, explains how to offset hyperthermia and hypothermia. He also explains how we can use the precise timing and location of cooling on our body to greatly enhance endurance and weight training performance. He describes how cooling technology discovered and engineered in his laboratory has led to a tripling of anaerobic (weight training) performance and allowed endurance athletes to run farther and faster as well as to eliminate delayed onset muscle soreness. Dr. Heller explains how heat impairs muscular and mental performance and how to cool the brain to reduce inflammation and enhance sleep and cognition. We discuss how anyone can apply these principles for themselves, even their dogs! Our conversation includes many practical tools and mechanistic science.

I discuss the immensely powerful chemical that we all make in our brain and body: dopamine. I describe what it does and the neural circuits involved. I explain dopamine peaks and baselines, and the cell biology of dopamine depletion. I include 14 tools for how to control your dopamine release for sake of motivation, focus, avoiding and combating addiction and depression, and I explain why dopamine stacking with chemicals and behaviors inevitably leads to states of underwhelm and poor performance. I explain how to achieve sustained increases in baseline dopamine, compounds that injure and protect dopamine neurons including caffeine from specific sources. I describe non-prescription supplements for increasing dopamine—both their benefits and risks—and synergy of pro-dopamine supplements with those that increase acetylcholine.

GzvzWO0NU50,Psychedelics for Treating Mental Disorders | Dr. Matthew Johnson,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzvzWO0NU50,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2021-09-20T12:00:09Z,605713,12545,"In this episode I discuss medical research on psychedelic compounds with Dr. Matthew Johnson, Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. We explore the biology and medical clinical trial uses of psilocybin, MDMA, ayahuasca, DMT and LSD.

Dr. Johnson shares what the clinical trials in his lab reveal about the potential these compounds hold for treating depression, addiction, trauma, eating disorders, ADHD and other disorders of the mind. He describes a typical psychedelic experiment in his laboratory from start to finish, including the conditions that support optimal clinical outcomes. He also outlines potential hazards along with common misconceptions and pitfalls related to psychedelic medicine.

Dr. Johnson explains flashbacks, the heightened risks certain people and age groups face when using psychedelics, and the ever-evolving legal and pharmaceutical landscape surrounding these substances. He discusses how the scientific study of psychedelics is likely to shape the future trajectory of psychiatric medicine.

As one of a small handful of researchers who have pioneered the clinical study of these powerful compounds, Dr. Johnson offers unprecedented insight into how they can be woven into other psychiatric treatments, changing one’s sense of self and reality.

hFL6qRIJZ_Y,ADHD & How Anyone Can Improve Their Focus,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFL6qRIJZ_Y,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2021-09-13T12:00:32Z,7053532,157226,"In this episode, I discuss ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder): what it is, the common myths, and the biology and psychology of ADHD.

I discuss both behavioral and pharmacologic treatments for ADHD, and brain-machine interface tools. I also discuss behavioral training protocols that can improve focus in people with ADHD and those without ADHD, and for people of different ages. I discuss the role of dopamine in coordinating 'default-mode' and 'task-related' neural networks, attentional ""blinks"" (lapses of attention) and how to overcome them, and the role of actual blinks in time perception and attention. Finally, I review some of the prescription and over-the-counter compounds for increasing focus such as Adderall, Ritalin, Modafinil and Armodafinil, the racetams, Alpha-GPC and phosphatidylserine and the role of diet for managing ADHD (and the controversies of diet for ADHD). 

The role of cell phones/technology in ADHD and ADHD-like challenges with focus are also discussed. Throughout, both basic science and clinical scenarios, as well as applicable tools and resources are covered.

I also address how protein is assimilated better early in the day than it is later in the day, and why those using intermittent fasting might want to shift their feeding window to earlier in the day.

Then I delve into the topic of disorders of eating: Anorexia Nervosa, where people starve themselves and Bulimia Nervosa where people binge and purge their food. I discuss some common myths about Anorexia such as the role of media images increasing the rates of anorexia and the myth of the ""perfectionist"" anorexic. I also review the symptoms, and the brain and chemical systems disrupted in this condition. I explain how anorexics become hyperaware of the fat content of foods and develop reflexive habits of fat-hyperawareness. Then I discuss the most effective treatments ranging from family-based models to those that target the habitual nature of low-fat/calorie food choices. I also discuss new more experimental clinical trials on MDMA, Psilocybin and Ibogaine for Anorexia, and both their promise and risks.

I review the latest work on binge eating disorder and brain stimulation, drug treatments and thyroid disruption in Bulimia and why the treatments for Bulimia are so similar to those for ADHD. Finally, I discuss ""cheat days,"" body dysmorphia and the growing list of novel forms of eating disorders start to finish. As always, science and science-based tools are discussed.

We discuss stress, what defines short-term versus long-term stress and how stress can be beneficial or detrimental depending on the context. We also discuss stress mitigation and how our sense of control over stress-mitigation techniques, including exercise, determines health outcomes. Dr. Sapolsky explains some of the key effects of the hormone testosterone—how it can amplify pre-existing tendencies for aggression or sexual behavior but does not produce those behaviors per se. He also explains how testosterone impacts our social hierarchies, sense of confidence and willingness to embrace challenges of different kinds. He further explains how our behaviors and perceptions shape testosterone levels. We also discuss estrogen and the powerful role it plays in brain development, health and longevity. Finally, we discuss free will, what it means to have free will and whether we have any, including how knowledge alone might allow us to make better decisions for ourselves and society.

I explain the three major chemical systems that are altered in depression: norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine. I discuss genetic predispositions to depression and how stress, thyroid hormone and cortisol play a role in many forms of depression. I also discuss inflammation as a common feature of many depression symptoms. I review 8 specific science-supported protocols for treating and avoiding depression, including EPA fatty acids (which have been shown to rival certain prescription treatments), how exercise protects against depression, studies of creatine, adjusting dopamine balance and more. I also discuss the results of ongoing clinical trials for ketamine and psilocybin for depression, how these compounds work and finally, I review how ketogenic diets can help in certain cases of depression, especially treatment-resistant major depression.

Dr. Lembke is a psychiatrist and expert in treating addictions of all kinds: drugs, alcohol, food, sex, video games, gambling, medication etc. She is also an expert in the opioid crisis and the author of Dopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence.

We discuss the biology and psychology of why people become addicted to certain substances and behaviors and the key role that our “dopamine balance” plays in creating addiction. We also explore the science and practice of how to conquer addictions, why people relapse and how to avoid relapsing. Dr. Lembke shares her expertise on topics closely related to addiction such as community, shame and lying, and she explains why telling the truth—even about the most basic things in daily life—adjusts dopamine levels in our brains.

This episode is an important one for anyone struggling with addictions of any kind, for their friends and families and for health care professionals. It is also for anyone who has defeated addiction and is determined to stay clean. Last but not least, it helps explain why all humans do what we do and how we can all maintain a healthy sense of pleasure seeking in life.

I discuss the science of behavioral tools like acupuncture and hypnosis and directed pressure, including the neural circuits they each activate to modulate our experience of pain or pleasure. I also discuss whole body pain, pain ""syndromes"" and novel pain relief compounds such as Acetyl-L-Carnitine, SAMe and Agmatine. I discuss neuroplasticity of the pain system and the key role that visual perception plays in pain modulation. Finally, I address the link between dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin, with arousal, pleasure and pain. As always, both basic science and various protocols are described.

Note: The description of the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) was intentionally simplified and does not include mention of dorsal horn spinal relay neurons, etc.. For an excellent full text review of this anatomy and circuits for touch sensing, please see: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3811145/

The conscious awareness of this brain-body dialogue is called interoception. I describe how two factors- mechanical forces (e.g., pressure, pain, volume, etc.) and chemical factors (e.g., gut acidity, microbiome diversity, etc.) combine to influence our moods, control inflammation, immune system, recovery from injury and more. I explain how specific actions of our lungs, heart, spleen, and diaphragm, control our brain via the vagus nerve and other neural pathways. I describe 11 science-supported protocols for enhancing brain-body health and the logic behind them.

I discuss sound localization, doppler effects (sound motion), pitch perception and how we isolate sounds in noisy environments. I also review the scientific findings on binaural beats and white noise and how they can improve learning. Other topics and protocols include tinnitus, sea sickness, ear movement, ear growth and the science-supported ways we can all accelerate learning using ""gap effects"".

How things smell and taste and bodily chemicals of others have a profound effect on how we feel, what we do and our hormones. I explain the 3 types of responses to smell, the 5 types of tastes, the possible existence of sixth taste sense. I explain how smell and taste reflect brain health and can be used to assess and even promote brain regeneration. Both basic science and protocols are described including how to make sour things taste sweet and how to develop a heightened sense of smell and taste.

I also describe how we can train and support our visual system to improve at any age. I describe more than a dozen protocols to support depth perception, offset near-sightedness, improve mood, sleep, and our ability to focus (both visual focus and our mental focus generally). I also explain how to use eyesight to improve our levels of alertness and why visual hallucinations, lazy eyes and colorblindness occur. I also describe various compounds that may assist in supporting visual health and possibly improve our vision. Many simple, zero-cost protocols and a lot of scientific mechanisms are covered in this episode in clear language anyone can understand-- it is for anyone that values their brain and their eyesight, whether young, adult-age or advanced age.

I describe the four kinds of endurance: muscular endurance, long duration (single-set) efforts, and the two kinds of high intensity interval training (HIIT). I discuss efficiency of effort and maximizing quality of effort, and a hydration formula. I review how our heart literally gets stronger when we oxygenate muscles properly. I also discuss motivation for long bouts of work and the visual physiological basis of the ""extra gear"" we all can leverage for effort. Finally, I review how accelerating as we fatigue can allow us to access untapped energetic resources.

I explain muscle metabolism and muscle fiber recruitment. I detail protocols for increasing muscular growth and for neuro-muscular recovery. I explain the effects of deliberate cold, anti-inflammatory agents, and anti-histamines on training progress. I describe science-supported protocols using certain weight load ranges, total sets per week, training intensity, frequency, and in-between set activities if one's goal is to increase muscle growth, strength or endurance. I review three foundational compounds and nutrients and three optimization compounds and nutrients that have been shown to improve neuro-muscular performance. Finally, I explain how to leverage exercise and weight training to enhance cognitive function.

Most people don't realize it, but our neurons connect to our fat and release epinephrine/adrenaline to facilitate fat oxidation. I explain how this can be accomplished with non-exercise movements such as fidgeting to burn thousands of calories of fat a day-- a practice is rarely discussed but very well supported by the science literature. I also discuss an optimal fat loss protocol using cold to create shiver, and how specific types and timing of exercise impact fat loss. I discuss if exercising fasted indeed increases fat oxidation-- it turns out the type and duration of exercise really matters. And I discuss the use of caffeine, GLP1 from Mate or guayusa and emerging new prescription compounds for fat loss. The episode includes a lot of tools, links to cost-free resources and explanation of the science underlying each tool for fat loss.

I also describe what to do immediately after a training session (note: this is different than the optimal protocol for cognitive skill training) and as you progress to more advanced levels of performance. I also cover the science of skill-based visualization which does have benefits, but only if done correctly and at the correct times. I discuss auto-replay of skill learning in the brain during sleep and the value of adding in post-training ‘deliberately idle’ sessions. I cover how to immediately improve limb-range-of-motion by leveraging cerebellum function, error generation, optimal repetition numbers for learning and more. As always, scientific mechanism, peer-reviewed studies and science-based protocols are discussed.

xaE9XyMMAHY,Supercharge Exercise Performance & Recovery with Cooling,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaE9XyMMAHY,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2021-05-10T12:00:17Z,358135,11880,"This episode I explain the science of heating and cooling the body, a process called thermoregulation-- and how to apply that knowledge to significantly improve physical performance. I describe the three areas of our body that can remove heat (or bring heat into the body) faster than anywhere else, why that is so, and how proper cooling of these areas with specific protocols can allow people to perform 200-600% more volume and repetitions of resistance exercises at the same weight loads, or to run, cycle or swim significantly further. I also describe how to use directed cooling of so-called glabrous skin: the bottoms of feet, palms and face, to significantly enhance recovery times from exercise. Also, why the common practices of trying to heat up or cool the body via the torso or whole-body submersion in cold can be inefficient and/or dangerous-- and the better alternatives. Finally, I discuss the temperature effects of caffeine, alcohol and anti-inflammatory compounds. The information in this episode is focused on mechanisms and tools for increasing athletic or exercise performance.

I also clarify that metabolism isn't just about burning energy, it’s about converting energy from different sources into fuels for building and repairing our tissues such as muscle, brain, and tendons and mobilizing energy from body fat storage. I discuss the role of iodine, selenium, and salt for thyroid health, and how specific exercise protocols, amino acids and temperature can dramatically shift levels of growth hormone release in waking and in sleep. I also describe the current landscape of prescription compounds, peptides and other factors for changing levels of thyroid and growth hormone, and some of their risks. Throughout the episode, mechanism and tools grounded in specific mechanisms are discussed. Thank you for your interest in science!

17O5mgXZ9ZU,"How Our Hormones Control Our Hunger, Eating & Satiety",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17O5mgXZ9ZU,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2021-04-19T12:00:01Z,1385395,35201,"This episode I discuss how hormones from our gut, liver, pancreas and brain control our appetite-- and the specific tools we can use to adjust those hormones in order to achieve specific goals. I explain the brain areas that control our desire to eat, and our desire to stop eating. I discuss a hormone we all can make that is regulated by UV-rays from sunlight that reduces our appetite. I also explain that when we eat controls our appetite and not the other way around (and how to leverage that fact). I describe how we are basically always eating until we reach a threshold level of fatty acids and amino acids in our gut and the factors that can alter that signaling and make us eat far more than we need. I also explain how insulin, glucose and glucagon work, why cholesterol is so key for ovary, adrenal, liver and testes function and how the ketogenic diet impacts glucose and thyroid levels. As always, I describe many tools: specific supplements, prescription compounds, specific types (and timing) of exercise to regulate hormones, specific timing and types of eating, ways to reduce sugar cravings by triggering the release of the hormone CCK, and more. 

Note: A future episode will cover Thyroid hormone. Also, I misspoke when explaining POMC neurons. I said “P-M-O-C” but should have said “POMC”. Apologies. The name I gave for what POMC is, however, was correct: ""proopiomelanocortin"".

qJXKhu5UZwk,The Science of How to Optimize Testosterone & Estrogen,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXKhu5UZwk,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2021-04-12T12:00:13Z,2363858,57693,"This episode I discuss the hormones testosterone and estrogen and how they impact the brain, body, and behavior at ages after puberty. I also discuss how various behaviors such as exercise (resistance and endurance training) and sex, or observing sex impact these hormones and their levels. I ask: ""what specifically is it about such activities that impact testosterone and estrogen?""; the resounding theme is that when our nervous system is activated in particular ways it drives our endocrine system and vascular system to activate or repress certain hormone networks in predictable ways. I also discuss peer-reviewed studies and protocols addressing (at a mechanistic level) how light, cold and heat, and respiration (breathing) can positively or negatively impact testosterone and estrogen. And we discuss specific supplements and compounds that peer-reviewed studies illustrate can adjust testosterone and estrogen levels: by changing their binding to other proteins, by raising them directly, or by changing other hormones released from the brain and pituitary. I discuss optimization in the normal reference ranges for these hormones, and I discuss pheromones, apnea, menstrual cycles, menopause and andropause. As always a mix of basic science, biological mechanisms and tools and protocols are discussed.

**Note: Future episodes will focus on the science of prescription hormone replacement therapies, the science of hormone-based birth control and the role of testosterone, estrogen and other compounds in fertility, athletic performance and recovery.

I review published data on environmental factors shown to powerfully alter hormone pathways in animals and humans and the effects of cannabis, alcohol and cell phones on testes, sperm, ovaries and hormones. I describe the predictable relationship between genes, beard growth and balding patterns, and the importance of estrogen for brain development in people of all chromosomal sexes. Finally, I discuss how the hormones we are exposed to in the womb shape the relative length of our finger digits, the sounds our ears make (yes you read that correctly), and how those correlate with people's self-reports of their sexual preferences. As always, basic information and tools are discussed.

hcuMLQVAgEg,The Science of Emotions & Relationships,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcuMLQVAgEg,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2021-03-29T12:00:13Z,2184140,45765,"In this episode, I discuss the biology of emotions and moods in the context of relationships. I focus on the science of how early infant-caregiver attachment, combined with adolescence and puberty shapes our adult patterns of attachment. I explain the three universal aspects of emotions, the reality of right-brain versus left-brain personalities, and how the roots of adult attachment are also grounded in specific aspects of puberty. I review what factors determine when puberty starts and ends, and the role of oxytocin and other chemicals in controlling how we perceive and remember others. As always, I refer to various practical tools including new tools for understanding and predicting our emotions before they occur, and neurochemicals that shape human connection.

I describe how dopamine, a chemical we all make in our brain, underlies our desire for and pursuit of our goals, as well as our capacity to move and experience pleasure. I describe how we can leverage specific behaviors, reward schedules and dopamine-prolactin balance to help ensure we can maintain motivation and capacity for pleasure over the long term. I also discuss dopamine in the context of ADHD, craving and addiction, and some absolutely amazing results about specificity of drug effects based purely on belief.

I discuss the vagus nerve and its role in dopamine and serotonin release in the brain. I review Omega-3 fatty acids and the key role of the gut microbiome in supporting (or hindering) our mental and emotional states. Many actionable tools are reviewed and discussed related to fasting, ketogenic and plant-based diets, probiotics, fermented foods, fish oils, artificial sweeteners, specific supplements that promote dopamine and serotonin, and some remarkable behavioral (and belief) effects.

I frame this in the context of our daily 24-hour cycle in order to make it practical, clear and precise about timing. I review the role of fasting, meal timing and specific types of nutrients for promoting certain states of mind. I also review various other tools and biological factors that directly or indirectly gate brain function and that we can control. I answer commonly asked questions about the science of psychedelics, binaural beats, and visualization. Thank you for your interest in science!

I describe the key role that errors play in triggering our brains to change and how the vestibular (balance) system can activate and amplify neuroplasticity. As always, I cover science, and science-based practical tools. Thank you in advance for your questions and for your interest in science!

I describe the differences between childhood and adult neuroplasticity, the chemicals involved and how anyone can increase their rate and depth of learning by leveraging the science of focus. I describe specific tools for increasing focus and learning. The next two episodes will cover the ideal protocols for specific types of learning and how to make learning new information more reflexive.

I discuss REM-associated dreams that control emotional learning and their similarity to various trauma treatments such as ketamine and EMDR. I also discuss Non-REM dreams and their role in motor learning and learning of detailed, non-emotionally-laden information. I relate this to science-backed tools for accessing more of the types of sleep and learning people may want. Other topics are listed in the time stamps below.

4b6bwcWK6GE,Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b6bwcWK6GE,Andrew Huberman,Huberman Lab,2020-12-23T15:00:05Z,1326103,20229,"Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast. I am Dr. Andrew Huberman. 

My plan in creating this podcast is to discuss neuroscience: how our brain and its connections with the organs of our body controls our perceptions, our behaviors, and our health. I will also discuss tools for measuring and changing how our nervous system works.

Upcoming episodes will cover: sleep and how to get better at sleeping, learning, dreaming, as well as motivation and focus and how to access more focus. We will also cover neuroplasticity, fear, and stress.

Along the way, I will discuss behavioral tools (""do's and don'ts""), and the role of nutrition, exercise, supplements, prescription drugs and electronic devices for measuring and changing the way our nervous systems work.

To suggest additional topics, please enter them in the comment section below. Also, be sure to ""like"" any comments suggesting topics you're interested in. I will shape the content of future podcasts accordingly.

Thank you for your interest in science!

-Andrew
